Before you can understand why people think that way I think you have to understand the underlying fundementals of most cryptocurrency; blockchain technology. \n\nIm going to attempt to explain blockchain as simple as I can.The \"blockchain\" is just a chronological history of past transactions, seperated into groups called blocks. These blocks are checked by everyone who uses Bitcoin  to insure that the transactions in the block does not have any fake transactions. Since everyone who uses Bitcoin checks the blocks, it makes the system decentralized, meaning that no central entity can control Bitcoin and what transactions can or cannot be in the blocks. The majority rules whats going to be in the blocks or not. This also extends to the \"rules \" of using bitcoin.For example, only the people can choose wether or not to include a fee to send Bitcoin. \n\nThere's alot of things I left out, but at its core this is what Bitcoin is. It's trying to take away power from the banks and government and putting it back to the people, allowing us to be in charge of our own money. Blockchain use  isn't just limited to just a currency either, there's a number of real world applications that Blockchain technology can be applied to to make a better functioning world; supply chain management, internet of things,  finance, are just a few.\n\nIf you want a more detailed explanation I highly recommend 3blue1browns explaination on how cryptocurrency works. I've watched many videos on how crypto works and his is the only one that clicked in my head.\n\n "

            "Can I be the guy that discourages you from mining? Beginner as well, and it seems to me unless you've got some horsepower (you don't) it's simply not worth it. Alternative mining methods like burstcoin also don't show much promise to me. Watch a couple videos about the large mining operations run by genesis, that should be more than enough to make you realize you're a drop of water in the ocean. Not trying to be mean, but if your goal is to accrue altcoins, you're much better off trading or holding for gain on larger coins. I'll wait here patiently for a smarter person to tell me why i'm wrong and you should spend $100 in electric to get $20 in coins."

It's similar to Tenx/Monaco/Metal and seems undervalued.\n\nSome others are $CFD (Confido), $CAT (Blockcat), $OAX (OAX), $LUN (Lunyr), $XAS (Asch), $MSP (Mothership) and $HMQ (Humaniq). All on the third page and all very decent picks :)\n\nInvest while they're underground, and  flatlined instead of when they're popular and rising.",

That way, your original fiat balance is essentially unchanged.\n\nEven if your portfolio did go to zero, you wouldn't have lost anything from your original investment.  The only loss would be the opportunity loss from not having cashed out when you were ahead.\n\nYour parents would be especially hard pressed to argue your course of action if you tell them you're re-upping your fiat account.\n",

I would recommend you any coin from my portfolio EXCEPT following: XAS, STRAT, TENX, MCO, EBET (these were mistakes).\n\nIf I have to be specific, you are mainly missing LTC, ETH and maybe some WAVES/OMG.",

OPSkins is #1 in trading digital assets like skins. They process between 15b and 23b of the 50 billion market.\n\nWAX will be a utility token, not only currency. It allows decentralized marketplaces with trustless trades. No game integration required.\n\nIt will start as ETH token, but will be developing their own DPOS blockchain for the volume and features it will allow. It will use every feature of DPOS as a tool. \n\n completion planned for end of 2018/start of 2019.\n\nOPSkins will not be the only marketplace to use WAX, it will be it's first user of WAX. WAX solves a lot of problems. \n\nOPSkins is a global company with the majority of trades being different countries with different currencies. These conversion fees are a problem. Introducing WAX ;)\n\nPassionate supporter, no affiliation other than I invested in the Gamer sale.",
            "Also, Amber is a pure utility token, the CEO came out and said they don\u2019t want it to go up in price as the token itself is only for utility, it\u2019s a big reason why I didn\u2019t invest.  I was going to but then I backed away from it.  \n\nNice thing about MOD is they pay out dividends in the form of ETH.  I love passive income so that\u2019s why I went with MOD instead of AMB.",

            "Ethereum currently hundreds of times faster and cheaper than Bitcoin",
            "Agree. The Ethereum community is far more focused on creating a winning product rather than just making money. Ironically, in this end this will see Ethereum with the most money and Bitcoin creating a bad product that's good for nothing other than parking your money. \n\nBitcoin's got the name though - it'll probably only increase in value, and the fact that it's hideously clunky and expensive for everyday transactions will mean it will only be hoarded and not really spent. ",
            "Pretty awesome tech, and I agree it's an improvement over BTC. Then again, IOTA takes the fee//TX time to a unbeatable level. I can't wait to see how they'll compete with Ethereum in a year or so. Ethereum has its shit together.",

            "When I\u2019m injecting fiat into my portfolio I use ETH now. No brainer. Keep your money. ",
            "I don't think transaction volume and confirmation speeds should be taken without looking at the impact it has on security. A blockchain is firstly a decentralized security mechanism. Trading off that security for speed and scalability is not really impressive. If that becomes the metric, then old protocols like PayPal end up being the winner anyway. \n\nThe transaction volume with Ethereum goes at the expense of a bigger bandwidth and disk requirements. Shorter confirmations are less sure to not be rolled back by a group of miners. \n\nThe goal is to reach all those metrics with the highest decentralized security possible _and_ improving capabilities and developer tools at the service time.\n\nNow the Ethereum community is really doing this. With constant improvements on clients requiring less bandwidth, less disk usage, higher processing speeds, more features and a huge community working on building tools. But I don't think it's fair to say it's better at everything because of that. ",

            "Just bought into Iexec myself. I found it really heady and boring type of stuff, BUT:\n\n- Cloud based Dapps that are decentralized. Releasing a \"store\" for these dapps in December.\n- Started on eth, but can/is moving to other blockchains.\n- French roots and Huge co-development program partnership with China.\n- They are currently recruiting developers to work on their newly developed sdk. \n- Apparently, really good feedback from devcon regarding this sdk.\n- Running a contest to develop dapps for their store.\n- Projected to be in market thats worth $200 Billion in 2020. (Current mrktcap is 45+mill.) \n- Read a few places people were calling it the \"AirBnB for servers.\"\n\nCONS\n\n- Minimal marketing for the time being. \n- Word of mouth will drive this tech. \n\nWonderful investment in my opinion. \n\n",

Even then, 20% is awfully high.  \n\nI know ASIC-resistance is a very shiny concept right now, particularly because of the drama with Bitcoin, but I'm not convinced it's a long-term problem facing crypto.  Plenty of other coins can still actively fight centralized mining.  Monero has already pledged to hard fork if they deem it necessary.  And PoS coins, such as ARK, LSK, and NAV, don't have the problem at all.",
            "I would add NAV and ETH. I'm not really too sure about ARK. And LSK seems like more of a short-term buy with their new tech and partnerships.. not sure about long term prospects. ",
            "Does anyone have anything bad to say about NAV?",
            "I hope NAV will implement Atomic Swaps soon. Then there would be no reason for Vertcoin imo.",
            "Yeah, the other day, I was specifically trying to find cons, and couldn't find any compelling ones. I could for other somewhat similar coins, like Vertcoin and Monero, which I'm invested in, but NAV just seems very undervalued for what it is.",
            "I can't say anything definitely **bad**. However I have several points that I am sceptical about. One is the anonymity, and how it is achieved. I read the whitepaper and was confused about it. It looks to me like it is less than solid. More like obscuring transactions via a side-chain and not really untraceable when it comes to inputs and outputs. I'm not certain, just sceptical so don't take my word for it.\n\nI'm also sceptical that such a small project is going to be able to deliver everything they plan. It aims to have dapps that are anonymous. That is no small task. I think that a coin such as NAV, with PoS, attempted privacy/anonymity, dapps etc. Will try too much to be a jack of all trades and fail to be really good at anything. Again, this is speculation on my part, just how I see it.\n\nLast time I heard, they only had part time devs. Perhaps that has changed now.\n\nusually the really smart investors are early to catch potential. IMO the reason NAV is valued low is...because it is not worth more. The expert investors usually have these things pinned down pretty well and as soon as NAV delivers something big, the price will most likely rise, if not before due to hype from regular users. When enough holders of NAV shill it, here for example, it will catch up.\n\nNow I know it sounds as if I dislike NAV, I don't. I just try to stay realistic about projects. I don't think that it is so much NAV that is undervalued, as other coins being overvalued. Just look at Verge for example, waaay overvalued. NAV is a better project, however that does not mean it should be priced higher. It all depends on what you compare with. Compared to shitcoins with higher marketcap, I believe that NAV is undervalued. Compared to the big/groundbreaking projects, I think NAV is pretty good where it is, for now. \n\nTLDR: Nothing wrong with NAV, it just has to prove to actually do something unique. So far it is just grand plans. \n\n",

And I would never buy into Chinacoin no matter what it promises, I don't like the idea of China controlling my investment (if they don't now, they certainly will if it ever gains enough marketshare -- they can just march in and sieze control and nobody could do anything to stop them).

Only about $1m invested during Series A. Beta launch in Toronto targeted for December/January.

            ">\u201cI heard what was going on, and I kept trying to make sense of the conversion rate,\u201d said concertgoer Andrew Prady, who was stuck behind Flaxer in line. \u201cApparently, half a FlaxxX is equal to about five Cyber-Chits, but you have buy them between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. PST. Those can be converted to Camel Cash C-Notes via an Indonesian pawn shop, and sent via Western Union to a Mexican pharmacy in exchange for non-FDA-approved Botox with a street value of almost a grand. After that, it got really confusing.\u201d\n\nThe fuck did I just read lmao",
            "I can't say anything definitely **bad**. However I have several points that I am sceptical about. One is the anonymity, and how it is achieved. I read the whitepaper and was confused about it. It looks to me like it is less than solid. More like obscuring transactions via a side-chain and not really untraceable when it comes to inputs and outputs. I'm not certain, just sceptical so don't take my word for it.\n\nI'm also sceptical that such a small project is going to be able to deliver everything they plan. It aims to have dapps that are anonymous. That is no small task. I think that a coin such as NAV, with PoS, attempted privacy/anonymity, dapps etc. Will try too much to be a jack of all trades and fail to be really good at anything. Again, this is speculation on my part, just how I see it.\n\nLast time I heard, they only had part time devs. Perhaps that has changed now.\n\nusually the really smart investors are early to catch potential. IMO the reason NAV is valued low is...because it is not worth more. The expert investors usually have these things pinned down pretty well and as soon as NAV delivers something big, the price will most likely rise, if not before due to hype from regular users. When enough holders of NAV shill it, here for example, it will catch up.\n\nNow I know it sounds as if I dislike NAV, I don't. I just try to stay realistic about projects. I don't think that it is so much NAV that is undervalued, as other coins being overvalued. Just look at Verge for example, waaay overvalued. NAV is a better project, however that does not mean it should be priced higher. It all depends on what you compare with. Compared to shitcoins with higher marketcap, I believe that NAV is undervalued. Compared to the big/groundbreaking projects, I think NAV is pretty good where it is, for now. \n\nTLDR: Nothing wrong with NAV, it just has to prove to actually do something unique. So far it is just grand plans. \n\n",
            "Copy-pasting from my response to [yesterday's shill thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7cskd2/coins_with_low_market_cap_and_high_potential/).\n\n---\n\n[**Pink**](https://np.reddit.com/r/PinkApp/comments/79bx75/pinkapp_faq_a_blockchainfunded_dividendproducing/). High-risk, high-reward.\n\nBusiness model that just makes sense, tapping into the $200b sex industry. Not trying to invent new technology; just leveraging existing privacy and blockchain tech to create the [Uber/AirBnB of escorting apps](https://vimeo.com/239655911). Clients pay in cash, escorts pay a commission to Pink, dividends go to investors via ETH and/or XMR.\n\nSeries A investment closed, Series B opening in a few weeks at $2.50/share with IPO target for 2018 Q1 at $10. Only about $1m invested during Series A. Beta launch in Toronto targeted for December/January. Rollout in other major cities to follow.\n\nEven more bullish on it since [Eros-Guide was recently raided](http://www.xbiz.com/news/231580/report-eros-guides-call-center-is-raided) by the Department of Homeland Security. There's a need for a site that can protect both client/escort personal information and provide a slick, convenient booking experience for both parties.\n\n---\n\n**Official Site**  \nhttps://pinkapp.io\n\n**Video Demo**  \nhttps://vimeo.com/239655911\n\n**FAQ**  \nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/PinkApp/comments/79bx75/pinkapp_faq_a_blockchainfunded_dividendproducing"

Our recent jump in price also has also brought a lot of new people to Vertcoin and they seem to be just as excited to share.\n\nOne thing I\u2019d like to clear up is that these posts and shills are not representative our our coin or larger community. We pride ourselves with that claim that we have one of the best communities in crypto and we truly believe it. We\u2019ll continue to do our best to work with our community, but I just ask all of you judge Vertcoin objectively by its philosophy & technology and not by a few posts in a subreddit.\n\nThanks!\n",

But the more shilling I see, the more I wonder if the price bumps are a result of echo-chamber hype or actual buy-in from the community.\n\nCurrently I'm sticking to my plan as a long hodl.  I agree with others here that say the community aspect of the coin naturally brings more excitement among people on messages boards.  \n\nI'm keeping my eye on things though.  I think OP raises a good point.",
            "If I\u2019m being honest, I try and identify obvious shill campaigns early so I can get in and get out quick. Easy money. \n\nEither way the results speak for themselves, VTC has gone up and stayed up. That being said, VTC isn\u2019t a bad coin and might actually deserve it. \n\nBut yeah, the shilling is super gross. But it\u2019s just one of a dozen seedy things about crypto right now anyway. ",
            "Have you research about Vertcoin to try to understand why are people so passionate about Vertcoin? Vertcoin gives back the power to the people. Simple as that. That's why I love Vertcoin over any other coin. And I don't believe Vertcoin has a get rich quick scheme like ethereum did back in the day or like ripple does. Vertcoin to me has fundamentals, it is fair and decentralized. There is really not a reason to hate it.",
            "You might be misattributing the boost in VTC value to the shilling campaigns. consider how much shilling IOTA has gotten, yet it's value hasn't maintained the tops.",
            "tl;dr: stay ignorant, I don't care. That's on you.\n\nI don't think you have a good idea about this coin, **and yes I actually shit and shat and spit all over this coin when I first heard about it**. But after a good hard look in the mirror about it's abilities, and what the power of an open source community is potentially able to accomplish. I've actually seen more pros coming out of VTC and it's community about ideas to tackle in this market with using their own tech then anywhere else in the crypto space. I'm not even joking, especially in the last 48 hours! This coin and its investors want to move, and the investors themselves can help move it by spreading more awareness, which is what you saw. Also the Radeon version of the One Click miner is also around the corner(Nvidia OCM is already out, was released last week) and the Discord I'm told is even more of active place.(I haven't had the time to sit down and chat- yet) *A lot of people say 'they've barely done any work in the last several months', thats completely untrue and misleading info.*\n\n\n\nVTC at the end of the day just keeps looking like the real winner in this market for it's price point and it's governing tech. It's actually decentralized instead of false promises of decentralization which Bitcoins essentially spelling out the last couple weeks, it's also easily mined and doesn't require ridiculous amounts of power, and for those two reasons literally every GPU owner can simply mine it in their spare time and add to its decentralized network. I personally see that type of decentralized blockchain a lot better then allowing the only profitability be to those who've been set up and had a monopoly on ASIC-resist-free(ASIC Ruled) blockchains this entire time; Russia, China, Bitmain. If I had to choose between leaving this market and moving to VTC, I moved to VTC. I can't justify buying into a market that claims its decentralized if it really isn't, that's a pyramid I don't play with. And if it's true about Bitmain and Bitcoin, then I guarantee this market will eventually fail and we'll use Jamie Dimon coin in the future.\n\n\n\nYou want to use Jamie Dimon coin? Personally I sure as fuck don't want to leave a centralized economic system, to move to another centralized economic system, arguably to avoid this monopolized + centralized economic crossroad.\n\n\n\nand BCH is not an acceptable replacement in this market. I feel bad for telling two personal friends to jump ship with me on Friday. we made a little money, but I couldn't pry them away! They wanted to stay and hodl! Oh God what the fuck did I do!? It's totally owned by Bitmain! Its all they accept for miners!\n\n\n\nThis markets turning into a secretive monopoly behind a lot of peoples backs very quickly that almost intentionally want to stay ignorant to it and drag other sheeple down with them, wake up and take the Green pill. \n\n",
            "Maybe *you're* a shill and this is reverse psychology. I can't help but notice I've never seen you and Vertcoin in the same room at the same time. ",
            "I'm a to the moon guy myself, but I don't think worshiping the coin every day with a new nothing-post is a good way to build support for it. We lose people like you who are put off by the shill posts, while also pushing away potential new investors. Remember that there are a lot of people in the Vertcoin community who are not just in it for the money but see something more in it (and that doesn't just apply to Vertcoin, but to any other community with the same issue), but the people you see at the front are the to the moon types. :) \n\nJust my 2 cents.",

            "Some vertcoin thoughts of mine (downvote me to frig if you'd like)\n\n1. There are at least 5 other strictly currency coins with leads on market cap. Sure, I know the response \"but the tech! Asic resistance!\". Whatever, fact is there is competition well ahead in market share and that is my first point.\n\n2. Asic resistance is ok, but is that really going to stop mining whales from significantly outpacing your average joe? I'd say no, but who knows maybe AMD/NVIDIA would have a problem selling a large chunk of their silicon to one buyer. \n\n3. That awful name. Ok this is petty and a matter of taste, but vertcoin makes me think of teenage skateboarders or old folks trying to be hip. Cringe. \n\nWell that's all, but what do I know? Yall will probably murder my gainz. \n\n",

What's really new since 2014? VTC posts updates on language additions, tweets out and then someone posts about it here. Making it sound like an actual update.\n\n3. Dear goodness the upvotes (the main VTC post on the front page for example).\n\n4. More coordination on the sub /r/Vertcoin about shilling. Theyre open and don't even care that other people see it. Please go see their sub.\n\n5. They praise things that their coin does, that other currency does or mulitple do. \n\n6.

Even then, 20% is awfully high.  \n\nI know ASIC-resistance is a very shiny concept right now, particularly because of the drama with Bitcoin, but I'm not convinced it's a long-term problem facing crypto.  Plenty of other coins can still actively fight centralized mining.  Monero has already pledged to hard fork if they deem it necessary.  And PoS coins, such as ARK, LSK, and NAV, don't have the problem at all.",

            "I\u2019m pretty sure this coin is dead unfortunately. Not trying to spread FUD or be unnecessarily negative but this coin was quite clearly and pump and dump off of vertcoin a success. Hopefully I\u2019m wrong but I\u2019m just trying to help anyone still holding it. ",
            "Just hiding transaction amounts is not anonymous. You still can see who sent to whom and how much someone owns. \nIf John owns 10 LTC and a few hours later after selling his drugs on a DNM he owns 11 LTC, and Jim did a Confidential transaction to John, it\u2019s easy to know that Jim sent 1 LTC to John. \nThis is just a small confidentiality bonus and it isn\u2019t even default.\n\nIMHO Litecoin is endangered by Vertcoin. But I appreciate both currencies. ",
            "So dropping an ASIC mined coin for another almost identical ASIC mined coin is a good idea? Interesting.\n\nHow about drop the Bitmain coins for something GPU mined like VTC.",

            "I can't say anything definitely **bad**. However I have several points that I am sceptical about. One is the anonymity, and how it is achieved. I read the whitepaper and was confused about it. It looks to me like it is less than solid. More like obscuring transactions via a side-chain and not really untraceable when it comes to inputs and outputs. I'm not certain, just sceptical so don't take my word for it.\n\nI'm also sceptical that such a small project is going to be able to deliver everything they plan. It aims to have dapps that are anonymous. That is no small task. I think that a coin such as NAV, with PoS, attempted privacy/anonymity, dapps etc. Will try too much to be a jack of all trades and fail to be really good at anything. Again, this is speculation on my part, just how I see it.\n\nLast time I heard, they only had part time devs. Perhaps that has changed now.\n\nusually the really smart investors are early to catch potential. IMO the reason NAV is valued low is...because it is not worth more. The expert investors usually have these things pinned down pretty well and as soon as NAV delivers something big, the price will most likely rise, if not before due to hype from regular users. When enough holders of NAV shill it, here for example, it will catch up.\n\nNow I know it sounds as if I dislike NAV, I don't. I just try to stay realistic about projects. I don't think that it is so much NAV that is undervalued, as other coins being overvalued. Just look at Verge for example, waaay overvalued. NAV is a better project, however that does not mean it should be priced higher. It all depends on what you compare with. Compared to shitcoins with higher marketcap, I believe that NAV is undervalued. Compared to the big/groundbreaking projects, I think NAV is pretty good where it is, for now. \n\nTLDR: Nothing wrong with NAV, it just has to prove to actually do something unique. So far it is just grand plans. \n\n"
