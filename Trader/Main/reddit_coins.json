Also where is the development on NEO, who is working to make the platform better, what advantages does it have over ETH, what uses does it have? ICOs? Bah, ETH is already ICO king platform, I laugh at people claiming that NEO will overtake ETH as the leading smart contract platform when they have no development, no testing, no product while ETH probably has one of the smartest group of people in the planet working to make the platform better and suitable for mass adoption. Only thing NEO has done is change its name from Ant to NEO, big fucking deal, but hey, at least its the Chinese Ethereum copy.\n\nDon't fall for pumping idiots",

Should the network process all those and keep them on chain forever, raising bandwidth requirements (and storage) that high for everyone, and thus compromising security? \n\nNo. Limit has to be placed somewhere on spectrum of security vs speed. BTC chooses security, and use layer 2+ for speed. But they did introduce 1mb to 2-4mb max block weight increase with segwit. Most blocks now are over 1mb. So already they traded off some security for speed increase but also enabled layer 2 solutions required.\n\nSo when someone says they can go faster by changing a few parameters, ask them what they GIVE UP for it: [1](https://twitter.com/SDWouters/status/862426991370358784),[2](https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/881851053913899009),[3](https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/881852318517473280)\n\nIt is a real solution: https://hackernoon.com/simulating-a-decentralized-lightning-network-with-10-million-users-9a8b5930fa7a\n\nIt's not a simple answer, most people start off as completely for speed until they realize the trade offs. \n\nIf I want super fast but very limited in # validators (elected 25-100 witnesses), I'd use bts or steem (free tx) to go faster than VISA for small tx - both process 2x+ more tx than btc and eth combined.

Monero & Dash are my two biggest non-bitcoin holdings, and looking for more privacy-focused coins led me to XSPEC. The main reason I like this project is its implementation of Tor & obsf4. Users in countries that are cracking down on Tor usage can still access the Spectre network.

            "What $8 fees? https://bitcoinfees.21.co/ I see $4 to get into next block for average tx. Larger tx like sending to 1000 accounts takes more fee, but similar per tx.\n\nThen you say confirmations take forever too. And $8 fees. That's VERY misleading as they are inversely correlated. If you analyze only tx that included a fee, median time is ~12 minutes https://blockchain.info/charts/median-confirmation-time which is most places require.\n\nWhat you are reading is typical rhetoric used by other coins to promote themselves, often because they are unused and do not mention downsides of their design\n\nYou're saying load without understanding that's an attack vector. \n\nAnyone can create a backlog, trillions per second. Should the network process all those and keep them on chain forever, raising bandwidth requirements (and storage) that high for everyone, and thus compromising security? \n\nNo. Limit has to be placed somewhere on spectrum of security vs speed. BTC chooses security, and use layer 2+ for speed. But they did introduce 1mb to 2-4mb max block weight increase with segwit. Most blocks now are over 1mb. So already they traded off some security for speed increase but also enabled layer 2 solutions required.\n\nSo when someone says they can go faster by changing a few parameters, ask them what they GIVE UP for it: [1](https://twitter.com/SDWouters/status/862426991370358784),[2](https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/881851053913899009),[3](https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/881852318517473280)\n\nIt is a real solution: https://hackernoon.com/simulating-a-decentralized-lightning-network-with-10-million-users-9a8b5930fa7a\n\nIt's not a simple answer, most people start off as completely for speed until they realize the trade offs. \n\nIf I want super fast but very limited in # validators (elected 25-100 witnesses), I'd use bts or steem (free tx) to go faster than VISA for small tx - both process 2x+ more tx than btc and eth combined. When I want security for large amounts, I use BTC. (Hard not to mention them since they are clear leaders in tx today and speed)\n\nIn the end it's possible you can spend entire life only on layer 2 LN network, have option to settle on layer 1, but most will never need it and it will be mostly used by large players like vendors and amazons of the world settling between each other taking on the costs.\n\nAdditionally, pegged side chains are good scaling opportunity as well without losing value - http://i.imgur.com/ENpXtTt.png - this is happening very soon too - https://stats.rsk.co/ - segwit allowed it to use drivechains instead of federated bridges which is huge win. RSK and also MAST for smart contracts are showing BTC ability to adapt good ideas from others. They do this without compromising the security of the foundation, building on the most secure and well understood platform possible.\n\nThere's 4+ lightning implementations including for mobile phones.\n\nNothing wrong with using altcoins for small amounts if you can't afford the fees or speed, until layer 2+ and sidechains are ready since you don't need high security for it. That is a speed solution. But lets not pretend they are equivalent, especially using a chain that shall not be named that can't manage to remain online for few months at a time without security breakdown of the entire chain. \n\ntldr: there's value in security, there's more than speed and fees that's important",

            "NEO is crap in my opinion, only argument people claim in its favor is that it is a Chinese ETH. The whole point of crypto is borderless finance, global currency, etc, why the hell is a centralized chinese coin a good thing? Also where is the development on NEO, who is working to make the platform better, what advantages does it have over ETH, what uses does it have? ICOs? Bah, ETH is already ICO king platform, I laugh at people claiming that NEO will overtake ETH as the leading smart contract platform when they have no development, no testing, no product while ETH probably has one of the smartest group of people in the planet working to make the platform better and suitable for mass adoption. Only thing NEO has done is change its name from Ant to NEO, big fucking deal, but hey, at least its the Chinese Ethereum copy.\n\nDon't fall for pumping idiots",
            "You need to have BTC in order to buy almost every other type of coin, especially the ones with lower market caps.  ETH and LTC are moderately well adapted, but BTC is the king.  I've thought about selling my BTC frequently in the past month, but I can't bring myself to do it, knowing that despite any inherent technical weaknesses, it's still a gateway drug and therefore will be in strong demand for some time.\n\nI'll reassess this opinion as I see more and more exchanges offering trades directly out of LTC or ETH into coins with small market caps (and to clarify, I know that there are some now - but the main couple of exchanges that I use are quite limited).\n",
            "What's fragmented? a few individuals fragment in any community, there's almost no support for any of those fragments. Anyone can snapshot a crypto and make their own coin, it's not a \"fragment\". Others exagerate it for no reason. Real fragment happened when eth devs stole money from a user without majority support and without even asking to vote and fragmented away from real chain while retaining full control due to centralization.\n\nthere is no project that has more developers or bigger community than bitcoin, or where more work was done for scaling. THe number of layer 2 implementations is enormous there, meanwhile all others are relatively stagnating and mostly just printing tokens.\n\nSo I don't have to repeat myself https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/6wqao8/why_are_you_so_chill_about_the_current_bitcoin/dm9zcw9/",
            "You are overexposed to bitcoin \"FUD\" and shitcoin hype, and underexposed to economic reality.\n\n---\n\nEveryone knows there can be only one money without state intervention.  Over half of the world's currency is pegged to the dollar.  Most of the rest is the Euro, which is just a client state of the USA.  Essentially, we have one world currency but most countries maintain a *nominally* independent currency simply so that they can exit (relatively) cleanly if the US becomes too burdensome.\n\nThis is because of the network effect of money.  Money's value does not come from gold, or the asset sheet of the federal reserve, or any other bullshit.  It is valuable only because lots of other people believe it is valuable.\n\nBitcoin has a chance at becoming money.  Shitcoins do not.\n\n---\n\n99.99% of the opinions you are reading are from technological illiterates.  Anonymous money is so awesome!  But, did you know that it is impossible to verify the total amount of money in circulation in some of the more anonymous coins?  How do you determine the value of dollar in a world where you are unsure if there are 100 of them or 100,000,000,000,0000,000,0000,0000,000 of them?  Right, you can't.  But there are shitcoins in this situation with market caps over $1B.  It's a joke.\n\n---\n\n\"Proof of Stake can solve scaling and save the environment!!!  LOL can't we all be friends?\"\n\nWe have a shitcoin called ethereum with a $30B valuation entirely built on liars and fraudsters.  When is the last time you believed someone who told you that you can get something for free?  Hopefully, a long, long time ago.\n\nAt the same time, all the ethereum idiots believe that today.  The cost of security in crypto is burning energy (mining).  PoS advocates are attempting to convince people you can take away the cost (burning energy) and keep the benefit (security).  It's a transparent fraud to any barely intelligent person, but there are an awful lot of victims of this latest iteration of crypto scamming.\n\n---\n\nWe could go on and on, but the TL;DR is this: all the smart people in the room know shitcoins are shitcoins.  Trading shitcoins is nothing more than a way to accumulate more bitcoins.  Almost everyone does it, but only the retarded are true believers.",

            "I think that there are a lot of parallels for what a crash would look like, but there are some important differences. During the .com crash there was a broad sector decline in value. Every tech company took a walloping and those that weren't profitable or which had fundamentally unsound business models were wiped out completely. Similarly, a crypto crash will likely see sharp declines across the board for all coins. The super dubious, craptastic recent ICOs will almost certainly disappear forever. Coins and tokens with no differentiating technical or business features will go for sure. However, I don't think the carnage will stop there. Most of the crypto products that are *very* similar to existing products will see their values plunge to next-to-worthless levels and they will likely never recover. This is where the similarities end.   \nThere is no direct comparison between \"business model\" and a crypto currency. However, there is a similar concept and that is market adoption and the technical infrastructure that goes with a coin. In this context, the survivors are already starting to emerge. They are bitcoin, ethereum, ripple and perhaps 3 or 4 others (not sure about litecoin, I personally feel it's too similar to bitcoin and doesn't have the ecosystem, but it's on the border).",

Great idea for crypto privacy, but given recent gov attention, restrictions will be put in place to squash the speculation on it far before it reaches BTC levels.\n\nThat's my two cents.

There are several altcoins that can do exactly what Bitcoin can do and have additional features as well. Bitcoin's transaction fees are absolutely ridiculous.

            "Thanks for your analysis - with the ICO madness and increasing amount of shady players in the crypto game, I will say that Sia is a breath of fresh air. Here is a post I put up a month ago or so on reasons I am big on Sia for the long-term:\n\n[Things I Considered Before Investing Into Sia](https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/comments/6lsfkz/things_i_considered_before_investing_into_sia/)\n\nThe Sia devs are extremely transparent and make a serious effort to engage and communicate with the community (growing super quickly - http://redditmetrics.com/r/siacoin). \n\nI am getting my Raspberry Pi 8TB hosting set up this week to add more capacity to the total storage but to also learn the ins and outs of Sia. I've also purchased a couple of Obelisk miners and created [this profitability calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19heDnA_o4Q8KuII4o1mKah7Sxafj85RSB-x-teN1SqE/edit#gid=0) to play around with some of the numbers. IMO, Siacoin is a great investment for a 3-5 year window but it's definitely not a get-rich-quick coin and I don't think it will ever go more than $1 per Siacoin but with enough volume, could be a nice ROI. ",
            "People have mentioned this here already but Bitcoin is a necessary entry to the altcoin game. Every time someone new ones to buy into an ICO or some other shitcoin they must first buy Bitcoin. This means their investments have a multipled effect (they pump Bitcoin as well as shitcoin X with that one fiat purchase). In some instances, people are going through 3 or 4 trades to get their desired crypto. (EX: Fiat>Bitcoin>CounterParty>Pepecash>rare pepe).\n\nCoupled with the fact that it a) is still difficult for many people to withdraw Bitcoin for fiat b) is cheaper/safer to hold Bitcoin than convert to USD and pay taxes/face charges c) goes against core sentiments of Bitcoin to trade it back for fiat- it's really a no brainer why the market keeps soaring. The question becomes how long this will last and wants the train runs out of steam, how hard will everything fall?",

            "These days I don't have many small-cap coins in my portfolio but one that I am liking is Spectre (XSPEC). Monero & Dash are my two biggest non-bitcoin holdings, and looking for more privacy-focused coins led me to XSPEC. The main reason I like this project is its implementation of Tor & obsf4. Users in countries that are cracking down on Tor usage can still access the Spectre network. While it is a never ending game of cat & mouse, the new developers that have joined the Spectre project have really proven their technical prowess. \n\nI don't expect Spectre to dethrone Monero, Dash or Zcash as the big 3 of privacy coins, but it is rather well developed and offers an alternative pathway. It is starting to pick up some momentum these days, but with its current market cap of ~$15m it is relatively unknown and qualifies as a sleeper IMHO.

            "It is a bubble. $164 billion dollar market cap, yet there is **not a single coin** that is actually used as a currency. Most don't even have a working product, and the ones that do (eg TenX) are nowhere near adoption by regular consumers. The current craze is fully driven by speculators, not by people actually **using** the cryptocoins. It's the [Dutch Tulip Mania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania) of the 17th century all over again.\n\nThat being said, blockchain technology will stay and some will be extremely successful, just like some internet companies remaned or became very successful after the bubble. And right now there is absolutely money to be made since the early majority adopters are currently flocking to the game. But just one look at [todays NEO-market](https://i.imgur.com/kSW8NcP.png) shows how nervous the market is. If it crashes (and it will, because the current market is not healthy), it's going *poof* really fast. And after that, it will rise again, based on more solid products and more common sense.",

This is great for the long term prospects of the currency, especially as it's key focus (decentralised mining) is likely to become a hot topic in crypto in the future, as bigger coins struggle due to being beheld to interests of mining pools. But obviously not so great for short term gains. Atomic swapping later this year could also be a boon for the coin, as VTC is likely to be (one of the) first to gain the capability, in collaboration with LTC.",

Good luck. ",

The coin has a lot of promising things going for it, so I would highly recommend considering it.\n\nArk is also trending down, so I'd be cautious/patient before jumping in.\n\nI'd also recommend giving OMG and LSK a look.

I've thought about selling my BTC frequently in the past month, but I can't bring myself to do it, knowing that despite any inherent technical weaknesses, it's still a gateway drug and therefore will be in strong demand for some time.\n\nI'll reassess this opinion as I see more and more exchanges offering trades directly out of LTC or ETH into coins with small market caps (and to clarify, I know that there are some now - but the main couple of exchanges that I use are quite limited).\n",

            "I think that there are a lot of parallels for what a crash would look like, but there are some important differences. During the .com crash there was a broad sector decline in value. Every tech company took a walloping and those that weren't profitable or which had fundamentally unsound business models were wiped out completely. Similarly, a crypto crash will likely see sharp declines across the board for all coins. The super dubious, craptastic recent ICOs will almost certainly disappear forever. Coins and tokens with no differentiating technical or business features will go for sure. However, I don't think the carnage will stop there. Most of the crypto products that are *very* similar to existing products will see their values plunge to next-to-worthless levels and they will likely never recover. This is where the similarities end.   \nThere is no direct comparison between \"business model\" and a crypto currency. However, there is a similar concept and that is market adoption and the technical infrastructure that goes with a coin. In this context, the survivors are already starting to emerge. They are bitcoin, ethereum, ripple and perhaps 3 or 4 others (not sure about litecoin, I personally feel it's too similar to bitcoin and doesn't have the ecosystem, but it's on the border).",

Could be easily replaced by ETH, Dash, etc.\n\nETC - Dead, ETH is better in every imaginable way\n\nBCC - Obvious scamcoin\n\nZEC - Obsolete by zk-SNARKS on Eth",

Also, correct me if I'm wrong but if they take manual snapshots of the network to decrease Tangle size, that makes it centralized?\n\nBCH - Has nothing on Litecoin. Slower transaction times, higher transaction fees... Isn't even Bitcoin, it's a fork. Useless.\n\nDash - Has nothing to offer besides quick transaction times. That's great and all, but we're seeing other coins pick up on that (LTC, IOTA, NEO(?))\n\nThere's a lot of other obvious failures (Zcash, ETC, QTUM) but I won't go into them because they're obvious.

That rules out Augur and Etheroll. Don't know much about the others to comment, hope this helped you though. You're in far too many useless coins in my opinion (sorry if overly harsh)\n\nedit: Yep, as usual Reddit produces the goods - downvote me while BTC and OMG surge to new highs and FUN holds its ground, while most other alts are tanking. I've actually provided OP a substantial argument as to why these are good buys, but continue saying how good an investment litecoin, BCC, NEO etc. are.",
            "Golem has exploded since the start of the year and I think the market might be waiting for the upcoming Brass release and it should receive a decent bump.\n\nVTC is a bit a of a sleeper agent imo. The developers and reasonably active community are very focused on the tech and while their marketing game has been lifted of late, this isn't where resources are primarily allocated. This is great for the long term prospects of the currency, especially as it's key focus (decentralised mining) is likely to become a hot topic in crypto in the future, as bigger coins struggle due to being beheld to interests of mining pools. But obviously not so great for short term gains. Atomic swapping later this year could also be a boon for the coin, as VTC is likely to be (one of the) first to gain the capability, in collaboration with LTC.",

The whole point of crypto is borderless finance, global currency, etc, why the hell is a centralized chinese coin a good thing? Also where is the development on NEO, who is working to make the platform better, what advantages does it have over ETH, what uses does it have? ICOs? Bah, ETH is already ICO king platform, I laugh at people claiming that NEO will overtake ETH as the leading smart contract platform when they have no development, no testing, no product while ETH probably has one of the smartest group of people in the planet working to make the platform better and suitable for mass adoption.

The current craze is fully driven by speculators, not by people actually **using** the cryptocoins. It's the [Dutch Tulip Mania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania) of the 17th century all over again.\n\nThat being said, blockchain technology will stay and some will be extremely successful, just like some internet companies remaned or became very successful after the bubble. And right now there is absolutely money to be made since the early majority adopters are currently flocking to the game. But just one look at [todays NEO-market](https://i.imgur.com/kSW8NcP.png) shows how nervous the market is. If it crashes (and it will, because the current market is not healthy), it's going *poof* really fast. And after that, it will rise again, based on more solid products and more common sense.",

Also, correct me if I'm wrong but if they take manual snapshots of the network to decrease Tangle size, that makes it centralized?\n\nBCH - Has nothing on Litecoin. Slower transaction times, higher transaction fees... Isn't even Bitcoin, it's a fork. Useless.\n\nDash - Has nothing to offer besides quick transaction times. That's great and all, but we're seeing other coins pick up on that (LTC, IOTA, NEO(?))\n\nThere's a lot of other obvious failures (Zcash, ETC, QTUM) but I won't go into them because they're obvious.

I expect this to be the first Stratis sidechains, in addition to Blitzcash which was announced some time ago. Stratis is in a race to implement sidechains with Ark, and Ardor/NXT. \n\nStratis also has their Breeze wallet, which has TumbleBit integration. An alpha of Breeze should be released within the next two months; but they've verified and stress-tested Tumblebit within the wallet. Plus, they have one of the most professional crypto teams that I've come across. \n\nThe June price spike for Stratis wasn't a pump and dump, but was an early indication of their future success.\n\nDisclosure: I am/we are long STRAT."

At $1,000 trying to double your money it could be as short as a month or even 2 weeks. I haven't heard of any big exchanges over the last few weeks being hacked that weren't the end users fault clicking on phishing links. 90+% chance you'd be fine on the exchange. 99.9% on your wallet (MEW or hardware) assuming you did it correctly. \n\nJust be sure you remember your goal. It can be very easy to get caught up in the pumps and think well I doubled my money, might as well triple it right? But no one really knows what's going to happen day to day with all of this. Don't keep going unless you are willing to lose it all. Take out your initial investment if you do so you can at least claim to be playing with house money even though that's an easy way to lose a lot.\n\nTl;dr keeping coins on proven exchange is probably be fine and more convenient, but a wallet would be safer\n"

Also, correct me if I'm wrong but if they take manual snapshots of the network to decrease Tangle size, that makes it centralized?\n\nBCH - Has nothing on Litecoin. Slower transaction times, higher transaction fees... Isn't even Bitcoin, it's a fork. Useless.\n\nDash - Has nothing to offer besides quick transaction times. That's great and all, but we're seeing other coins pick up on that (LTC, IOTA, NEO(?))\n\nThere's a lot of other obvious failures (Zcash, ETC, QTUM) but I won't go into them because they're obvious.

Has anyone verified this claim with SIA COIN?\nAccording to this image Kim dot coms new platform allows you to store on siacoin. \n\nheres the image\nhttp://imgur.com/a/6Cku7\n\nIt's on K.im as a demo.\n\nI tried the service but I'm unsure if he's hosting it server side or on siacoin. You can sign up for the beta invite.",
            "Thanks for this post. Siacoin has been one of the few altcoins that has peaked my interest since it has a potentially really good use case.\n\nThe explanation on how hosting is limited/penalized is really good. Im hoping the upcoming changes, specifically the small file size change, will help adoption pick up.",
            "One point i find important with Siacoin is the integration with Nextcloud. Nextcloud users are not like the average joe...  They are well informed and ready to experiment new tech. So it could get some momentum from them while waiting for some companies partnerships which would dramatically increase the coins value. ",
            "One important thing that should be called out... if anyone plans on actually hosting for Siacoin and aren't on a high end internet connection you will blow through your bandwidth cap in no time flat.\n\nThe additional question that many of these distributed computing projects need to answer up front is are you legally responsible for what is stored on your hardware or is it fully encrypted and you are 100% free from any legality issues?",
            "Thanks for your analysis - with the ICO madness and increasing amount of shady players in the crypto game, I will say that Sia is a breath of fresh air. Here is a post I put up a month ago or so on reasons I am big on Sia for the long-term:\n\n[Things I Considered Before Investing Into Sia](https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/comments/6lsfkz/things_i_considered_before_investing_into_sia/)\n\nThe Sia devs are extremely transparent and make a serious effort to engage and communicate with the community (growing super quickly - http://redditmetrics.com/r/siacoin). \n\nI am getting my Raspberry Pi 8TB hosting set up this week to add more capacity to the total storage but to also learn the ins and outs of Sia. I've also purchased a couple of Obelisk miners and created [this profitability calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19heDnA_o4Q8KuII4o1mKah7Sxafj85RSB-x-teN1SqE/edit#gid=0) to play around with some of the numbers. IMO, Siacoin is a great investment for a 3-5 year window but it's definitely not a get-rich-quick coin and I don't think it will ever go more than $1 per Siacoin but with enough volume, could be a nice ROI. ",

            "No analysis of siafund as well as siacoin in an evaluation of Sia? It's an important part of the Sia ecosystem and an interesting if expensive investment option, the only cryptocurrency worth more than a bitcoin :-)",
            "I believe the analysis should be much more simple than that.  Like all utility coins, I believe the value of the coin will peak at right under the cost of similar services from their competitors.  \nFor example, the price of Siacoin shouldn't rise over the price that it costs to purchase the same amount of storage from Dropbox.  Otherwise, their service becomes unusable causing less people to buy for utility and the price to drop.  This should also keep the coin from dropping too far below the competitors price.  As the coin gets cheaper, so does the service.  This makes people buy more coin and drive the price back up.  This rule should hold for all utility coins.  Speculation may drive the price slightly higher or lower, but not by much.",

            "What $8 fees? https://bitcoinfees.21.co/ I see $4 to get into next block for average tx. Larger tx like sending to 1000 accounts takes more fee, but similar per tx.\n\nThen you say confirmations take forever too. And $8 fees. That's VERY misleading as they are inversely correlated. If you analyze only tx that included a fee, median time is ~12 minutes https://blockchain.info/charts/median-confirmation-time which is most places require.\n\nWhat you are reading is typical rhetoric used by other coins to promote themselves, often because they are unused and do not mention downsides of their design\n\nYou're saying load without understanding that's an attack vector. \n\nAnyone can create a backlog, trillions per second. Should the network process all those and keep them on chain forever, raising bandwidth requirements (and storage) that high for everyone, and thus compromising security? \n\nNo. Limit has to be placed somewhere on spectrum of security vs speed. BTC chooses security, and use layer 2+ for speed. But they did introduce 1mb to 2-4mb max block weight increase with segwit. Most blocks now are over 1mb. So already they traded off some security for speed increase but also enabled layer 2 solutions required.\n\nSo when someone says they can go faster by changing a few parameters, ask them what they GIVE UP for it: [1](https://twitter.com/SDWouters/status/862426991370358784),[2](https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/881851053913899009),[3](https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/881852318517473280)\n\nIt is a real solution: https://hackernoon.com/simulating-a-decentralized-lightning-network-with-10-million-users-9a8b5930fa7a\n\nIt's not a simple answer, most people start off as completely for speed until they realize the trade offs. \n\nIf I want super fast but very limited in # validators (elected 25-100 witnesses), I'd use bts or steem (free tx) to go faster than VISA for small tx - both process 2x+ more tx than btc and eth combined. When I want security for large amounts, I use BTC. (Hard not to mention them since they are clear leaders in tx today and speed)\n\nIn the end it's possible you can spend entire life only on layer 2 LN network, have option to settle on layer 1, but most will never need it and it will be mostly used by large players like vendors and amazons of the world settling between each other taking on the costs.\n\nAdditionally, pegged side chains are good scaling opportunity as well without losing value - http://i.imgur.com/ENpXtTt.png - this is happening very soon too - https://stats.rsk.co/ - segwit allowed it to use drivechains instead of federated bridges which is huge win. RSK and also MAST for smart contracts are showing BTC ability to adapt good ideas from others. They do this without compromising the security of the foundation, building on the most secure and well understood platform possible.\n\nThere's 4+ lightning implementations including for mobile phones.\n\nNothing wrong with using altcoins for small amounts if you can't afford the fees or speed, until layer 2+ and sidechains are ready since you don't need high security for it. That is a speed solution. But lets not pretend they are equivalent, especially using a chain that shall not be named that can't manage to remain online for few months at a time without security breakdown of the entire chain. \n\ntldr: there's value in security, there's more than speed and fees that's important"

There still remains filecoin, storj, and maidsafe. \n\nFilecoin says PoW is wasteful and they have a smart PoS of sorts. They are SEC compliant already. \n\nStorj had a lot of drama going on, and I believe it is fairly centralized at the moment. Last I checked there were plans to decentralized more. \n\nAnd Maidsafe is... An encrypted storage/communication network? It confuses me so. Are they competing with any of the above?\n\n\n"

They've partnered with Earth Twine, a company that will be adding compliance to regulation of seafood onto the blockchain, such as verification of the origin and date the seafood was caught. I expect this to be the first Stratis sidechains, in addition to Blitzcash which was announced some time ago. Stratis is in a race to implement sidechains with Ark, and Ardor/NXT. \n\nStratis also has their Breeze wallet, which has TumbleBit integration. An alpha of Breeze should be released within the next two months; but they've verified and stress-tested Tumblebit within the wallet. Plus, they have one of the most professional crypto teams that I've come across. \n\nThe June price spike for Stratis wasn't a pump and dump, but was an early indication of their future success.\n\nDisclosure: I am/we are long STRAT.",

            "What $8 fees? https://bitcoinfees.21.co/ I see $4 to get into next block for average tx. Larger tx like sending to 1000 accounts takes more fee, but similar per tx.\n\nThen you say confirmations take forever too. And $8 fees. That's VERY misleading as they are inversely correlated. If you analyze only tx that included a fee, median time is ~12 minutes https://blockchain.info/charts/median-confirmation-time which is most places require.\n\nWhat you are reading is typical rhetoric used by other coins to promote themselves, often because they are unused and do not mention downsides of their design\n\nYou're saying load without understanding that's an attack vector. \n\nAnyone can create a backlog, trillions per second. Should the network process all those and keep them on chain forever, raising bandwidth requirements (and storage) that high for everyone, and thus compromising security? \n\nNo. Limit has to be placed somewhere on spectrum of security vs speed. BTC chooses security, and use layer 2+ for speed. But they did introduce 1mb to 2-4mb max block weight increase with segwit. Most blocks now are over 1mb. So already they traded off some security for speed increase but also enabled layer 2 solutions required.\n\nSo when someone says they can go faster by changing a few parameters, ask them what they GIVE UP for it: [1](https://twitter.com/SDWouters/status/862426991370358784),[2](https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/881851053913899009),[3](https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/881852318517473280)\n\nIt is a real solution: https://hackernoon.com/simulating-a-decentralized-lightning-network-with-10-million-users-9a8b5930fa7a\n\nIt's not a simple answer, most people start off as completely for speed until they realize the trade offs. \n\nIf I want super fast but very limited in # validators (elected 25-100 witnesses), I'd use bts or steem (free tx) to go faster than VISA for small tx - both process 2x+ more tx than btc and eth combined. When I want security for large amounts, I use BTC. (Hard not to mention them since they are clear leaders in tx today and speed)\n\nIn the end it's possible you can spend entire life only on layer 2 LN network, have option to settle on layer 1, but most will never need it and it will be mostly used by large players like vendors and amazons of the world settling between each other taking on the costs.\n\nAdditionally, pegged side chains are good scaling opportunity as well without losing value - http://i.imgur.com/ENpXtTt.png - this is happening very soon too - https://stats.rsk.co/ - segwit allowed it to use drivechains instead of federated bridges which is huge win. RSK and also MAST for smart contracts are showing BTC ability to adapt good ideas from others. They do this without compromising the security of the foundation, building on the most secure and well understood platform possible.\n\nThere's 4+ lightning implementations including for mobile phones.\n\nNothing wrong with using altcoins for small amounts if you can't afford the fees or speed, until layer 2+ and sidechains are ready since you don't need high security for it. That is a speed solution. But lets not pretend they are equivalent, especially using a chain that shall not be named that can't manage to remain online for few months at a time without security breakdown of the entire chain. \n\ntldr: there's value in security, there's more than speed and fees that's important",
            "The simple truth of the matter is, that no trustless blockchain can be at the same time:\n- decentralised and secure\n- widely successful as a payment solution\n- have affordable tx fees.\n\nTrustless blockchains propagate every transaction  ever to every full node.  If you do the math for what that means to compete with fiat/visa/paypall, its pretty obvious this cant work. You can make the blocks, and thus the chain, 2x larger, 10x larger,  100x larger,  it won't solve the problem fundamentally. First off, as long as transactions are really cheap, the blockchain will be abused, filled up with spam (by competing blockchains for instance), non transaction messaging, satoshidice crap and what have you, until the blocks get full enough that market pricing of this permanent, ultrasecure decentralised storage reaches an equilibrium.\n\nBut more importantly,  to compete with volumes of Visa and the like, blocks would need to be so large, that virtually no one would be able to run a full node, because the storage requirements and the processing requirements would mean a high end PC wouldnt cut it, you'd need your own datacenter, not unlike VISA. And thus you kill decentralisation and security. Already with a pretty young currency like bitcoin, that \"no one\" uses, with tiny 1MB blocks, the blockchain has grown big enough that we are struggling to have enough full nodes (we lost like 95% of them over the last few years). Time will make this worse, bigger blocks will make this a LOT worse.\n\nOff chain payment channels truly is the only way to achieve scaling. Small payments to pay for your pizza dont need to settle on the blockchain instantly, and some limited counterparty risk for a short period of time, is entirely acceptable. Yes, LN can be implemented on other coins, so what? Bitcoin is still (by far) the most secure blockchain, and payment channels settling on it, rather than some obscure altcoin will still be more desirable. Not so much for the user who wants to pay for his pizza, but for whoever operates the payment channels.",
            "Funny how what we call BTC today diverged more than BCH from \"the original\". BTC introduced a whole new TX format, and BCH only changed one parameter. What's closer to \"vanilla Bitcoin\"? If you want exposure to SegWitCoin I don't see the point of holding BTC and LTC. Pick just one, IMO. I hold none. Only XMR & BCH now.",
            "Bitcoin is such a joke. They just \"scaled\" after a two year hardcore WAR over segwit. And there is no sight of sinking fees or higher TX volume. It will take years before segwit goes into effect, if at all.  \n  \nKodak was first at digital photography.  \nNokia was first on mobile phones.  \nBitcoin was first on crypto currencies.  \n  \nYou know the story...."

You can make the blocks, and thus the chain, 2x larger, 10x larger,  100x larger,  it won't solve the problem fundamentally. First off, as long as transactions are really cheap, the blockchain will be abused, filled up with spam (by competing blockchains for instance), non transaction messaging, satoshidice crap and what have you, until the blocks get full enough that market pricing of this permanent, ultrasecure decentralised storage reaches an equilibrium.\n\nBut more importantly,  to compete with volumes of Visa and the like, blocks would need to be so large, that virtually no one would be able to run a full node, because the storage requirements and the processing requirements would mean a high end PC wouldnt cut it, you'd need your own datacenter, not unlike VISA. And thus you kill decentralisation and security. Already with a pretty young currency like bitcoin, that \"no one\" uses, with tiny 1MB blocks, the blockchain has grown big enough that we are struggling to have enough full nodes (we lost like 95% of them over the last few years). Time will make this worse, bigger blocks will make this a LOT worse.\n\nOff chain payment channels truly is the only way to achieve scaling. Small payments to pay for your pizza dont need to settle on the blockchain instantly, and some limited counterparty risk for a short period of time, is entirely acceptable. Yes, LN can be implemented on other coins, so what? Bitcoin is still (by far) the most secure blockchain, and payment channels settling on it, rather than some obscure altcoin will still be more desirable. Not so much for the user who wants to pay for his pizza, but for whoever operates the payment channels.",
            "People have mentioned this here already but Bitcoin is a necessary entry to the altcoin game. Every time someone new ones to buy into an ICO or some other shitcoin they must first buy Bitcoin. This means their investments have a multipled effect (they pump Bitcoin as well as shitcoin X with that one fiat purchase). In some instances, people are going through 3 or 4 trades to get their desired crypto. (EX: Fiat>Bitcoin>CounterParty>Pepecash>rare pepe).\n\nCoupled with the fact that it a) is still difficult for many people to withdraw Bitcoin for fiat b) is cheaper/safer to hold Bitcoin than convert to USD and pay taxes/face charges c) goes against core sentiments of Bitcoin to trade it back for fiat- it's really a no brainer why the market keeps soaring. The question becomes how long this will last and wants the train runs out of steam, how hard will everything fall?"

You are traveling through parts of a country with a medium to high violent crime rate. You need to use some of your Bitcoin to pay for something. If every person you transact with knows exactly how much money you have, this is a threat to your personal physical safety.\n> 2. You are a business that receives a payment from a supplier. That supplier will be able to see how much money your business has, and therefore can guess at how price sensitive you are in future negotiations. They can see every single other payment you\u2019ve ever received to that Bitcoin address, and therefore determine what other suppliers you are dealing with and how much you are paying those suppliers. They may be able to roughly determine how many customers you have and how much you charge your customers. This is commercially sensitive information that damages your negotiating position enough to cause you relative financial loss.\n> 3.  You are a private citizen paying for online goods and services. You are aware that it is common practice for companies to attempt to use \u2018price discrimination\u2019 algorithms to attempt to determine the highest prices they can offer future services to you at, and you would prefer they do not have the information advantage of knowing how much you spend and where you spend it.\n> 4. You sell cupcakes and receive Bitcoin as payment. It turns out that someone who owned that Bitcoin before you was involved in criminal activity. Now you are worried that you have become a suspect in a criminal case, because the movement of funds to you is a matter of public record. You are also worried that certain Bitcoins that you thought you owned will be considered \u2018tainted\u2019 and that others will refuse to accept them as payment.",

As cryptos gain popularity, Bitcoin will continue to grow until upon reaching a critical mass it will come crashing down and be replaced by a new standard. Imagine how unlikely it would be for a first of its kind technology to prevail after thousands of attemps to create something that is better for a certain applications (e.g. Monero for anonymous transactions, Doge for micropayments) or just strictly better as a whole (literally anything else).

            "These days I don't have many small-cap coins in my portfolio but one that I am liking is Spectre (XSPEC). Monero & Dash are my two biggest non-bitcoin holdings, and looking for more privacy-focused coins led me to XSPEC. The main reason I like this project is its implementation of Tor & obsf4. Users in countries that are cracking down on Tor usage can still access the Spectre network. While it is a never ending game of cat & mouse, the new developers that have joined the Spectre project have really proven their technical prowess. \n\nI don't expect Spectre to dethrone Monero, Dash or Zcash as the big 3 of privacy coins, but it is rather well developed and offers an alternative pathway. It is starting to pick up some momentum these days, but with its current market cap of ~$15m it is relatively unknown and qualifies as a sleeper IMHO. Considering it pretty much only trades on cryptopia, it is surprising to see it do between 20-100btc in daily volume. Anyways, that's my .02. Any thoughts on Spectre (XSPEC)?",
            "BCH - Even though I like the concept there is no way it can topple BTC, since it's so much more widely known and cemented.\n\nXRP - No development activity, ETH has more banks on board, tokens are close to worthless\n\nLTC - Glorified BTC clone. Could be easily replaced by ETH, Dash, etc.\n\nETC - Dead, ETH is better in every imaginable way\n\nBCC - Obvious scamcoin\n\nZEC - Obsolete by zk-SNARKS on Eth",
            "Let me take a risky jab at some popular ones. Hold off on the downvote and challenge my statements.\n\nIOTA - For the use they described (robots paying eachother), any reasonably large company would create their own Tangle network. Also, correct me if I'm wrong but if they take manual snapshots of the network to decrease Tangle size, that makes it centralized?\n\nBCH - Has nothing on Litecoin. Slower transaction times, higher transaction fees... Isn't even Bitcoin, it's a fork. Useless.\n\nDash - Has nothing to offer besides quick transaction times. That's great and all, but we're seeing other coins pick up on that (LTC, IOTA, NEO(?))\n\nThere's a lot of other obvious failures (Zcash, ETC, QTUM) but I won't go into them because they're obvious. Feel free to challenge me on anything I've said though!",
