            "Disclaimer I own ARK and DNT and has done quite a bit of reasearch on them.\n\nI believe ARK to be the most secure one. If you are planning on holding an asset for more than a year and not touching it, this would be my choice. It is a solid team with a solid roadmap and a lot of ideas (maybe too many). Argument for not investing in ARK is that it has just risen 25% today, so might not be the best timing, and it has risen 22.407% since its ICO, so you are quite late to the party. However, I still believe it has great potential, but don't expect it to 10x in 3 months. \n\nDNT is the more riskier higher reward choice. It had bullrun of 7x in a week or two and the dropped 50% without any news. The bullrun might have placed its value too high, but I believe the recent bear market for DNT has been a bit too extreme. If you are ever going to enter DNT, now might be a good time. A lot of the people trading DNT are waiting for Bittrex decision on whether DNT is a security or not.  This decision will probably decide if the price explodes or drops, so DNT has great potential but also larger short term risk. This is also seen from its way lower market cap than ARK and OMG.",
            "Ark is great but literally mid pump as we speak, wait for it to drop. DNT is the opposite, super cheap and still waiting to be listed on Bittrex. I would buy now. OMG has been fairly stable at current pricepoint so I'd say now it a good time to get into it.",
            "not possible to say anything wrong about ARK, its all good.. even the early mistakes.",
            "I just bought a little bit of DNT, it seems like it could grow a nice amount. I've been wanting to get into ARK and OMG for a while now. Waiting for some fiat to come. And it seems like ARK is in a pump now so maybe it'll go down a bit.",
            "ARK is undervalued. Going to rise very soon. Allmost doubled in a few weeks and will go very high very soon. Best wallet Youll see and the voting and delegate system work great. Youll get a 5%-7% interest Every year. And its Paid daily! Youll get Free Ark Every day!",
            "Ive nothing bad to say about Ark and OmiseGo, and havent researched DNT. Also interested to hear if others can offer critiques of ARK and OMG.",
            "If you've been reading up on them you should know the risks.  I'd say the least risky is OMG, with DNT being (currently) the biggest risk.  I personally don't like ARK - but I didn't read their whitepaper thoroughly so I'm prepared to be wrong.  As far as I could tell it only rewards the top 51 holders, as only the top 51 get to forge ARK.  This means the devs and their friends and family are perhaps the only beneficiaries.  I gave up the moment I read that.  It's as bad as the 20% kickback that ZCash devs get.  \n\nSaying that, look at ZCash - the extremely controversial kickback to devs hasn't stopped that coin has it?  So ARK could be amazing.  However, I feel that for actual spending coins XMR and IOTA have pretty much got things covered.\n\nIt's your money, don't listen to me or anyone else.  The markets go against everything I think one day and the next everything goes as I thought.  Truth is almost every coin is going up overall.  You could literally invest with a blindfold on, go away for six months and you'll almost certainly have much more than you originally invested.\n\nOr you can sit there and stress all day, constantly checking how much each has gone up or down.  Wishing you'd put everything into Crown (old coin set to rise) instead.  Then feel depressed, and wake up one day having all but given up on your investment, only to click in and see that one of your investments has gone from 0.000050  to 0.154345  overnight - and you've got 50,000 of them, the other has gone from .0064234  to .0843454 - suddenly the world lights up for you.\n",

            "POS coins don't require a masternode, smaller amounts work too, however in POS your wallets needs to be on, so there is an electricity cost associated.\n\nAlso don't get confused by dividends. In all POS coins, the supply grows at the same rate as the reward, meaning that receiving that reward does not actually increase the value of your stack. It is profitable because not all people are staking their coins.\n\nIn ark for example the total supply grows by a little less than 5% a year. Because not everyone votes (the devs don't, and the bounty reserve does not and because some people store the ark on exchanges), which means that you receive about 10% a year, meaning you earn 5% a year. Always subtract inflation.\n\nFor example in the Netherlands right now, interest is at 0.1%, meaning you effectively lose 2% of your money if you keep it in a bank.",

            "XRP because that thing is either for banks, and random users shouldnt even have an option buying it, or its for everyone to use in which case its pointless because no one actually uses it for anything.\n\nXMR because I have no idea why. I guess I always felt XMR is hard to scale and its just a proof of concept for some future privacy coin that will take the space. I guess I failed there.\n\nBAT and others in the space, because users wont change their browsers to watch ads. Its insanely hard and competitive space dominated by giants, and having a crypto token in the mix is actually a detriment to the nearly pointless effort. Its a cool idea, I just dont see it working in the real world.\n\nMCO, PAY - love the cards, tokens are stupid.\n\nAnd plenty more. Pretty much any coin/token promising perfectly bright future and butterflies, but with no working and actually used product.",

            "The reason litecoin has increased is due to a battle between bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH).  BCH instituted a difficulty adjustment making BCH much more profitable to mine than BTC.  Miners flipped chains (BCH actually had more hash rate than BTC for awhile) but flipped back at the next adjustment.  This lead to a wild oscillation of miners flipping between chains every difficulty adjustment.  This caused the rate of blocks mined to vary tremendously (even for BTC) and transactions piled up.  This uncertainty caused people to invest in litecoin.  Litecoin is very similar to bitcoin but uses a different hash function (so miners can't flip).    "

They use a lot of buzzwords, which they made up to explain other buzzwords, which they made up. It's all about \"districts\", but what the fuck is a \"district\" really? Apparently it's an autonomous smart-chain contract block solution for distributed independent ledger technologies in a secure smart-space environment. Or something.\n\nI am getting really tired of companies hiding behind buzzwords instead of explaining to people why they need something which they didn't know they needed. That's what Apple does so well and what is sorely lacking in the crypto community. Not everyone is a hyper-optimistic computer scientist.\n\nActually, I think I am going to focus more on coins that don't try to be anything other than a currency from here on out, as I just don't understand the need for all that other stuff. (Not saying it ain't there, but if you can't explain it to me, you're failing)",
            "The way I understand it (and I could be completely wrong, if so someone please correct me)\n\nWhen a miner is contributing to a blockchain network they are essentially exchanging some value for transaction fee while performing tasks. They are incentivized to validate accurately in both scenarios in two different ways.\n\nIn PoW, they miners are providing a certain amount of real world value (the resources needed to run their mining machines) in exchange for transaction fees. If the miner does not provide an accurate block, they essentially forfeit the fees thus leaving them in a net negative (as they used the resources to run their mining machines with no return).\n\nIn PoS, the miner is again providing a certain amount of real world value (in this case the real world value is the value of the coins staked) in exchange for transaction fees. Again, if the minor does not provide an accurate block, they still forfeit the transaction fees. On top of that, in PoS they also forfeit their staked tokens (in the same way the resources consumed to generate an inaccurate block in a PoW scenario would be lost).\n\nBoth provide a certain amount of up front value by the minor that is lost when not being truthful. However, in a PoW scenario, we are essentially burning real world value (resources needed to run the mining computations) as a way for the miner to have to provide a unit of value up front to risk when validating. These resources are consumed REGARDLESS of whether the miner is being truthful, which makes a PoW consensus not very efficient (in terms of real world resources needed to run it). In a PoS model, the value \u2018staked\u2019 is digital value (ethereum) which means that we don\u2019t need large amounts of real world resources consistently burning just to provide the minors with a mechanism for risking value (the risking value is the key piece that incentives truthful consensus).\n\nThe thing is that in a PoS scenario you need to ensure that a) you have a significant distribution of tokens and b) the tokens have a significant and fairly stable value. This is why ethereum has started in PoW (to spread the tokens and establish stability) at which point they can switch to PoS."

            "If you've been reading up on them you should know the risks.  I'd say the least risky is OMG, with DNT being (currently) the biggest risk.  I personally don't like ARK - but I didn't read their whitepaper thoroughly so I'm prepared to be wrong.  As far as I could tell it only rewards the top 51 holders, as only the top 51 get to forge ARK.  This means the devs and their friends and family are perhaps the only beneficiaries.  I gave up the moment I read that.  It's as bad as the 20% kickback that ZCash devs get.  \n\nSaying that, look at ZCash - the extremely controversial kickback to devs hasn't stopped that coin has it?  So ARK could be amazing.  However, I feel that for actual spending coins XMR and IOTA have pretty much got things covered.\n\nIt's your money, don't listen to me or anyone else.  The markets go against everything I think one day and the next everything goes as I thought.  Truth is almost every coin is going up overall.  You could literally invest with a blindfold on, go away for six months and you'll almost certainly have much more than you originally invested.\n\nOr you can sit there and stress all day, constantly checking how much each has gone up or down.  Wishing you'd put everything into Crown (old coin set to rise) instead.  Then feel depressed, and wake up one day having all but given up on your investment, only to click in and see that one of your investments has gone from 0.000050  to 0.154345  overnight - and you've got 50,000 of them, the other has gone from .0064234  to .0843454 - suddenly the world lights up for you.\n",

            "eh. not much useful information. imho. just like your previous \"making a million $\"\n\n1. this year will be difficult to repeat. possible, but difficult. it's the exception, not the rule. putting 10k in the top 10 one year ago would've netted you about 200k. putting 10k in the top 10 in 2015 wouldn't have netted you more than 40-50k in august 2016, and going a year further back, 2014-2015 would've probably lost you some money (can't be arsed to do exact calculations, but i'll gladly do them if there's demand). plus, look at the prices (and marketcaps!) of the current top 10 (or go even further!) vs the ones from previous years. the difference is orders of magnitude!\n\n2. if you invested any time before May this year, you would have needed to do something *seriously* wrong to not make a good profit. research or no research\n\n3. i want to see your strategy in place for years 2014-15 or 2015-16, where the market was nowhere near as bullish\n\n4. your examples are kinda useless. XRP working with banks didn't coincide with any rally (it was pretty stable, almost static up to the beginning of april with a relatively small pump). XRP skyrocketed *just like every other altcoin* back in may/june. it's not unlikely XRP will be destroyed by ChainkLink+SWIFT. plus plus, afaik, banks are using the protocol, not the token, so by doing thorough research nobody in their right mind would've invested. ETH was also almost uninfluenced by the Alliance news. the NEO pump also had nothing to do with Alibaba. meanwhile, Factom (just to give one example) has existed for as long as Eth, has real world applications and very solid business partners and yadda yadda yadda, and it has just barely reached 30$ these past few days. will it go higher? probably. but i'd be lying if i said \"100%\" because we all saw what happened in June\n\nwith your research, would you have guessed the BCH rally this month just because Koreans pumped it? did you predict the rise of Dash and Monero? or the fall of DNT after so much hype, even though it ticks pretty much every box for \"future success story\"? could you have predicted Monaco exploding to 20\u00d7 its price in less than a month, even though it's a vastly inferior product to TenX, a coin that's been stagnant for a while? no? thought so...\n\nseriously, dude. it's mostly luck. let's stop pretending it's anything else. the market is *extremely* volatile, and it's difficult to predict what news will affect the market and what won't and when. sometimes you can go by \"buy the rumour sell the news\", while other times \"the news\" won't make a difference. plus, there are soooo many of the smaller coins that are used for p&d schemes it's very risky to invest. perhaps when cryptos will become ubiquitous and mainstream, then some kind of Buffet-like value investing will be feasible, but right now...\n\njust my 0.02\u20ac",

All based on speculation up until now, but because of the promises, paid articles etc. the coin value is skyrocketing. It could either go down hard when alledged promises are not met or it could further grow if it does, but it's all speculation.\n\nVertcoin on the other hand has a dedicated team with solid tech behind it. It's time will come but it has a harder time proving itself because people need to build up more trust in it and it's not being marketed a lot.

            "eh. not much useful information. imho. just like your previous \"making a million $\"\n\n1. this year will be difficult to repeat. possible, but difficult. it's the exception, not the rule. putting 10k in the top 10 one year ago would've netted you about 200k. putting 10k in the top 10 in 2015 wouldn't have netted you more than 40-50k in august 2016, and going a year further back, 2014-2015 would've probably lost you some money (can't be arsed to do exact calculations, but i'll gladly do them if there's demand). plus, look at the prices (and marketcaps!) of the current top 10 (or go even further!) vs the ones from previous years. the difference is orders of magnitude!\n\n2. if you invested any time before May this year, you would have needed to do something *seriously* wrong to not make a good profit. research or no research\n\n3. i want to see your strategy in place for years 2014-15 or 2015-16, where the market was nowhere near as bullish\n\n4. your examples are kinda useless. XRP working with banks didn't coincide with any rally (it was pretty stable, almost static up to the beginning of april with a relatively small pump). XRP skyrocketed *just like every other altcoin* back in may/june. it's not unlikely XRP will be destroyed by ChainkLink+SWIFT. plus plus, afaik, banks are using the protocol, not the token, so by doing thorough research nobody in their right mind would've invested. ETH was also almost uninfluenced by the Alliance news. the NEO pump also had nothing to do with Alibaba. meanwhile, Factom (just to give one example) has existed for as long as Eth, has real world applications and very solid business partners and yadda yadda yadda, and it has just barely reached 30$ these past few days. will it go higher? probably. but i'd be lying if i said \"100%\" because we all saw what happened in June\n\nwith your research, would you have guessed the BCH rally this month just because Koreans pumped it? did you predict the rise of Dash and Monero? or the fall of DNT after so much hype, even though it ticks pretty much every box for \"future success story\"? could you have predicted Monaco exploding to 20\u00d7 its price in less than a month, even though it's a vastly inferior product to TenX, a coin that's been stagnant for a while? no? thought so...\n\nseriously, dude. it's mostly luck. let's stop pretending it's anything else. the market is *extremely* volatile, and it's difficult to predict what news will affect the market and what won't and when. sometimes you can go by \"buy the rumour sell the news\", while other times \"the news\" won't make a difference. plus, there are soooo many of the smaller coins that are used for p&d schemes it's very risky to invest. perhaps when cryptos will become ubiquitous and mainstream, then some kind of Buffet-like value investing will be feasible, but right now...\n\njust my 0.02\u20ac",

            ">Research would have informed you of the Ethereum Alliance while ETH was $20 or less. https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/03/Enterprise-Ethereum\n\nfunny thing is we saw this, but this was after pretty much everyone agreed eth was a failure and centralized and people forgot about it completely and focused on better alts. A win for the good tech and punishment for bad.\n\nNope.\n\nthat news came up - of course it was a marketing move by that scam chain for companies to use private chains - surely, we thought, no one will actually think those companies will want any thing to do with public ethereum chain, this won't matter. well, we were correct about EEA companies having zero to do with public eth chain because its obviously unsecure and centralized. but we didn't expect how tech-illiterate and mentally deficient ethereum community has become after the exodus of all intelligent people and bought that up having little understanding of difference between public and private chains or difference between use and one of many experimental projects companies do. ICO's becoming popular was another sign of tech-illiteracy and became prime spot for targeting dumb money moon kids willing to trust strangers for projects unable to raise money via disciplined investors.\n\nwell, lessons we learned: fundamentals do not matter, crypto community is getting \"ethereumized\" i.e. dumber every day, and any news no matter how dumb and irrational is will probably create enormous profit.\n\n",

Its APIs will be REST based, and that means any language with a standard http library can hit it, which is most of them nowadays. Making it easy to adopt.\n\nI no longer care for C# support personally as a selling point. Care about platform, and actually using it.

            "I hate sounding like a commercial so I focus on risks only. This is their properties only, not investment advice as prices don't have to follow tech quality.\n\nark's only more unique play are bridges - connecting blockchains. This isn't a new concept. However this is a HUGE HUGE requirement:\n\n>In order for ARK to become the medium/intermediary between chains, each chain needs a small snippet of code implemented. It is very easy to insert and not harmful to any blockchain, current or otherwise. Once this tiny code is inserted into the core code of any blockchain, that\u2019s it. Now that blockchain is connected to ARK. We make it painless and extremely simple to implement, and will provide very easy to follow instructions with 24/7 support via slack chat.\n\nhttps://blog.ark.io/what-is-the-ark-smartbridge-and-how-does-it-work-1dd7fb1e17a0\n\nhowever it seems might not be the case anymore\n\n> Actually in the current implementation the hard fork is no longer needed. An intermediate node called the encode listener is used. Bridging a different blockchain does no longer require the cooperation of that blockchain. /u/randomstring12345678 said below\n\n~~Maybe someone can tell me how they plan to get BTC for example to add that snippet.~~\n\nthere are others connecting blockchains together: blocknet, heat, supernet, internet of coins, cosmos, just plain old atomic swaps w or w/o state channels, polkadot, few more.\n\nOtherwise it seems ok and well managed, but did do ICO which is a negative bc centralized funding, hard to fire devs, and so on.\n\n\n----\n\ndnt is just another attempt at dao on eth. why this one instead of another? who knows. DAO's existed since 2014 in bts, and since eth one failed several more attempts have appeared: ant and wings seem similar.\n\neth is probably going to succeed despite being centralized through misinformation as always and while cloning it is an improvement from 0 security, other aspects of it aren't much improved to warrant obvious switch away from it for its present community's preferences. They are even introducing trusted setup to eth via zk snarks, one of the best signs of developers lack of understanding in why trustless tech is important. Enormously better alternatives are coming built from ground up to be better, for example EOS (11 months) and heavily inspired by EOS dpos tech NEO (not sure on timeline for custom smart contracts live, someone help me) will both provide better alternatives imo by every category. \n\nit also had ICO and thus is unsecure and centralized and high risk\n\n---\n\nOMG - It doesn't really provide anything new at first you can't do better with even tech from 2014, future plan depends heavily on tech not written yet including state channels, ran by centralized company with all the funding including ICO and all the connections so good luck disagreeing with the leader of that \"decentralized\" organization\n\nOh yeah, and since typical ICO designs are the worst method possible for coin distribution for PoS, much like in eth, it's a huge security concern.\n\nfor positive aspects just read their websites, promising the world is easy.\n",
            "Do people really think this tech matters. It's eth only, one of the most universally hated fake crypto around without a single useful thing even possible since it's centralized, and this wants to trade between useless things only. Eth already has some \"exchanges\" for on chain token trade other projects had half decade ago.\n\nThis is one of the least interesting projects in the history of crypto right up there with putin coin.",

            "The way I understand it (and I could be completely wrong, if so someone please correct me)\n\nWhen a miner is contributing to a blockchain network they are essentially exchanging some value for transaction fee while performing tasks. They are incentivized to validate accurately in both scenarios in two different ways.\n\nIn PoW, they miners are providing a certain amount of real world value (the resources needed to run their mining machines) in exchange for transaction fees. If the miner does not provide an accurate block, they essentially forfeit the fees thus leaving them in a net negative (as they used the resources to run their mining machines with no return).\n\nIn PoS, the miner is again providing a certain amount of real world value (in this case the real world value is the value of the coins staked) in exchange for transaction fees. Again, if the minor does not provide an accurate block, they still forfeit the transaction fees. On top of that, in PoS they also forfeit their staked tokens (in the same way the resources consumed to generate an inaccurate block in a PoW scenario would be lost).\n\nBoth provide a certain amount of up front value by the minor that is lost when not being truthful. However, in a PoW scenario, we are essentially burning real world value (resources needed to run the mining computations) as a way for the miner to have to provide a unit of value up front to risk when validating. These resources are consumed REGARDLESS of whether the miner is being truthful, which makes a PoW consensus not very efficient (in terms of real world resources needed to run it). In a PoS model, the value \u2018staked\u2019 is digital value (ethereum) which means that we don\u2019t need large amounts of real world resources consistently burning just to provide the minors with a mechanism for risking value (the risking value is the key piece that incentives truthful consensus).\n\nThe thing is that in a PoS scenario you need to ensure that a) you have a significant distribution of tokens and b) the tokens have a significant and fairly stable value. This is why ethereum has started in PoW (to spread the tokens and establish stability) at which point they can switch to PoS."

            "eh. not much useful information. imho. just like your previous \"making a million $\"\n\n1. this year will be difficult to repeat. possible, but difficult. it's the exception, not the rule. putting 10k in the top 10 one year ago would've netted you about 200k. putting 10k in the top 10 in 2015 wouldn't have netted you more than 40-50k in august 2016, and going a year further back, 2014-2015 would've probably lost you some money (can't be arsed to do exact calculations, but i'll gladly do them if there's demand). plus, look at the prices (and marketcaps!) of the current top 10 (or go even further!) vs the ones from previous years. the difference is orders of magnitude!\n\n2. if you invested any time before May this year, you would have needed to do something *seriously* wrong to not make a good profit. research or no research\n\n3. i want to see your strategy in place for years 2014-15 or 2015-16, where the market was nowhere near as bullish\n\n4. your examples are kinda useless. XRP working with banks didn't coincide with any rally (it was pretty stable, almost static up to the beginning of april with a relatively small pump). XRP skyrocketed *just like every other altcoin* back in may/june. it's not unlikely XRP will be destroyed by ChainkLink+SWIFT. plus plus, afaik, banks are using the protocol, not the token, so by doing thorough research nobody in their right mind would've invested. ETH was also almost uninfluenced by the Alliance news. the NEO pump also had nothing to do with Alibaba. meanwhile, Factom (just to give one example) has existed for as long as Eth, has real world applications and very solid business partners and yadda yadda yadda, and it has just barely reached 30$ these past few days. will it go higher? probably. but i'd be lying if i said \"100%\" because we all saw what happened in June\n\nwith your research, would you have guessed the BCH rally this month just because Koreans pumped it? did you predict the rise of Dash and Monero? or the fall of DNT after so much hype, even though it ticks pretty much every box for \"future success story\"? could you have predicted Monaco exploding to 20\u00d7 its price in less than a month, even though it's a vastly inferior product to TenX, a coin that's been stagnant for a while? no? thought so...\n\nseriously, dude. it's mostly luck. let's stop pretending it's anything else. the market is *extremely* volatile, and it's difficult to predict what news will affect the market and what won't and when. sometimes you can go by \"buy the rumour sell the news\", while other times \"the news\" won't make a difference. plus, there are soooo many of the smaller coins that are used for p&d schemes it's very risky to invest. perhaps when cryptos will become ubiquitous and mainstream, then some kind of Buffet-like value investing will be feasible, but right now...\n\njust my 0.02\u20ac",

Because if it is utilized, this will be **HUGE** for Factom.\n\nFor those that don't understand Factom, this is one of its' countless potential use cases.

No LinkedIn page or any other profile. Must be hard developing a business if business partners cannot check out who they're dealing with? In the video he has to check his notes to sum up his education and experience.\n\nTheir [github](https://github.com/HyperCash/Hcash) repository is completely empty. As is their [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mkthcash/) page, [Reddit account](https://www.reddit.com/user/H_cash/) and other social media links.\n\nI don't know if it's a scam but it sure smells like it. These guys absolutely don't seem to know what they're talking about.",

Miners flipped chains (BCH actually had more hash rate than BTC for awhile) but flipped back at the next adjustment.  This lead to a wild oscillation of miners flipping between chains every difficulty adjustment.  This caused the rate of blocks mined to vary tremendously (even for BTC) and transactions piled up.  This uncertainty caused people to invest in litecoin.  Litecoin is very similar to bitcoin but uses a different hash function (so miners can't flip).    ",

            "eh. not much useful information. imho. just like your previous \"making a million $\"\n\n1. this year will be difficult to repeat. possible, but difficult. it's the exception, not the rule. putting 10k in the top 10 one year ago would've netted you about 200k. putting 10k in the top 10 in 2015 wouldn't have netted you more than 40-50k in august 2016, and going a year further back, 2014-2015 would've probably lost you some money (can't be arsed to do exact calculations, but i'll gladly do them if there's demand). plus, look at the prices (and marketcaps!) of the current top 10 (or go even further!) vs the ones from previous years. the difference is orders of magnitude!\n\n2. if you invested any time before May this year, you would have needed to do something *seriously* wrong to not make a good profit. research or no research\n\n3. i want to see your strategy in place for years 2014-15 or 2015-16, where the market was nowhere near as bullish\n\n4. your examples are kinda useless. XRP working with banks didn't coincide with any rally (it was pretty stable, almost static up to the beginning of april with a relatively small pump). XRP skyrocketed *just like every other altcoin* back in may/june. it's not unlikely XRP will be destroyed by ChainkLink+SWIFT. plus plus, afaik, banks are using the protocol, not the token, so by doing thorough research nobody in their right mind would've invested. ETH was also almost uninfluenced by the Alliance news. the NEO pump also had nothing to do with Alibaba. meanwhile, Factom (just to give one example) has existed for as long as Eth, has real world applications and very solid business partners and yadda yadda yadda, and it has just barely reached 30$ these past few days. will it go higher? probably. but i'd be lying if i said \"100%\" because we all saw what happened in June\n\nwith your research, would you have guessed the BCH rally this month just because Koreans pumped it? did you predict the rise of Dash and Monero? or the fall of DNT after so much hype, even though it ticks pretty much every box for \"future success story\"? could you have predicted Monaco exploding to 20\u00d7 its price in less than a month, even though it's a vastly inferior product to TenX, a coin that's been stagnant for a while? no? thought so...\n\nseriously, dude. it's mostly luck. let's stop pretending it's anything else. the market is *extremely* volatile, and it's difficult to predict what news will affect the market and what won't and when. sometimes you can go by \"buy the rumour sell the news\", while other times \"the news\" won't make a difference. plus, there are soooo many of the smaller coins that are used for p&d schemes it's very risky to invest. perhaps when cryptos will become ubiquitous and mainstream, then some kind of Buffet-like value investing will be feasible, but right now...\n\njust my 0.02\u20ac",
            "I thought this said Monaco... and I damn near had a heart attack.",
            "XRP because that thing is either for banks, and random users shouldnt even have an option buying it, or its for everyone to use in which case its pointless because no one actually uses it for anything.\n\nXMR because I have no idea why. I guess I always felt XMR is hard to scale and its just a proof of concept for some future privacy coin that will take the space. I guess I failed there.\n\nBAT and others in the space, because users wont change their browsers to watch ads. Its insanely hard and competitive space dominated by giants, and having a crypto token in the mix is actually a detriment to the nearly pointless effort. Its a cool idea, I just dont see it working in the real world.\n\nMCO, PAY - love the cards, tokens are stupid.\n\nAnd plenty more. Pretty much any coin/token promising perfectly bright future and butterflies, but with no working and actually used product.",
            "Because it doesn't rely on vague promises and marketing hype (paid ads, etc.). \n\nTake for example Monaco, it is skyrocketing awaiting the app release on August 31st which might or might not have \"VISA\" backing. All based on speculation up until now, but because of the promises, paid articles etc. the coin value is skyrocketing. It could either go down hard when alledged promises are not met or it could further grow if it does, but it's all speculation.\n\nVertcoin on the other hand has a dedicated team with solid tech behind it. It's time will come but it has a harder time proving itself because people need to build up more trust in it and it's not being marketed a lot. I strongly believe that the current value is the new baseline after the +1$ pump a few days back, with multiple articles/questions/etc. floating here on /CryptoCurrency. ",

ETH was also almost uninfluenced by the Alliance news. the NEO pump also had nothing to do with Alibaba. meanwhile, Factom (just to give one example) has existed for as long as Eth, has real world applications and very solid business partners and yadda yadda yadda, and it has just barely reached 30$ these past few days. will it go higher? probably. but i'd be lying if i said \"100%\" because we all saw what happened in June\n\nwith your research, would you have guessed the BCH rally this month just because Koreans pumped it? did you predict the rise of Dash and Monero? or the fall of DNT after so much hype, even though it ticks pretty much every box for \"future success story\"? could you have predicted Monaco exploding to 20\u00d7 its price in less than a month, even though it's a vastly inferior product to TenX, a coin that's been stagnant for a while? no? thought so...\n\nseriously, dude. it's mostly luck. let's stop pretending it's anything else. the market is *extremely* volatile, and it's difficult to predict what news will affect the market and what won't and when. sometimes you can go by \"buy the rumour sell the news\", while other times \"the news\" won't make a difference. plus, there are soooo many of the smaller coins that are used for p&d schemes it's very risky to invest. perhaps when cryptos will become ubiquitous and mainstream, then some kind of Buffet-like value investing will be feasible, but right now...\n\njust my 0.02\u20ac",

Argument for not investing in ARK is that it has just risen 25% today, so might not be the best timing, and it has risen 22.407% since its ICO, so you are quite late to the party. However, I still believe it has great potential, but don't expect it to 10x in 3 months. \n\nDNT is the more riskier higher reward choice. It had bullrun of 7x in a week or two and the dropped 50% without any news. The bullrun might have placed its value too high, but I believe the recent bear market for DNT has been a bit too extreme. If you are ever going to enter DNT, now might be a good time. A lot of the people trading DNT are waiting for Bittrex decision on whether DNT is a security or not.  This decision will probably decide if the price explodes or drops, so DNT has great potential but also larger short term risk. This is also seen from its way lower market cap than ARK and OMG.",
            "Ark is great but literally mid pump as we speak, wait for it to drop. DNT is the opposite, super cheap and still waiting to be listed on Bittrex. I would buy now. OMG has been fairly stable at current pricepoint so I'd say now it a good time to get into it.",
            "I just bought a little bit of DNT, it seems like it could grow a nice amount. I've been wanting to get into ARK and OMG for a while now. Waiting for some fiat to come. And it seems like ARK is in a pump now so maybe it'll go down a bit.",
            "Ive nothing bad to say about Ark and OmiseGo, and havent researched DNT. Also interested to hear if others can offer critiques of ARK and OMG.",
            "If you've been reading up on them you should know the risks.  I'd say the least risky is OMG, with DNT being (currently) the biggest risk.  I personally don't like ARK - but I didn't read their whitepaper thoroughly so I'm prepared to be wrong.  As far as I could tell it only rewards the top 51 holders, as only the top 51 get to forge ARK.  This means the devs and their friends and family are perhaps the only beneficiaries.  I gave up the moment I read that.  It's as bad as the 20% kickback that ZCash devs get.  \n\nSaying that, look at ZCash - the extremely controversial kickback to devs hasn't stopped that coin has it?  So ARK could be amazing.  However, I feel that for actual spending coins XMR and IOTA have pretty much got things covered.\n\nIt's your money, don't listen to me or anyone else.  The markets go against everything I think one day and the next everything goes as I thought.  Truth is almost every coin is going up overall.  You could literally invest with a blindfold on, go away for six months and you'll almost certainly have much more than you originally invested.\n\nOr you can sit there and stress all day, constantly checking how much each has gone up or down.  Wishing you'd put everything into Crown (old coin set to rise) instead.  Then feel depressed, and wake up one day having all but given up on your investment, only to click in and see that one of your investments has gone from 0.000050  to 0.154345  overnight - and you've got 50,000 of them, the other has gone from .0064234  to .0843454 - suddenly the world lights up for you.\n",

            "eh. not much useful information. imho. just like your previous \"making a million $\"\n\n1. this year will be difficult to repeat. possible, but difficult. it's the exception, not the rule. putting 10k in the top 10 one year ago would've netted you about 200k. putting 10k in the top 10 in 2015 wouldn't have netted you more than 40-50k in august 2016, and going a year further back, 2014-2015 would've probably lost you some money (can't be arsed to do exact calculations, but i'll gladly do them if there's demand). plus, look at the prices (and marketcaps!) of the current top 10 (or go even further!) vs the ones from previous years. the difference is orders of magnitude!\n\n2. if you invested any time before May this year, you would have needed to do something *seriously* wrong to not make a good profit. research or no research\n\n3. i want to see your strategy in place for years 2014-15 or 2015-16, where the market was nowhere near as bullish\n\n4. your examples are kinda useless. XRP working with banks didn't coincide with any rally (it was pretty stable, almost static up to the beginning of april with a relatively small pump). XRP skyrocketed *just like every other altcoin* back in may/june. it's not unlikely XRP will be destroyed by ChainkLink+SWIFT. plus plus, afaik, banks are using the protocol, not the token, so by doing thorough research nobody in their right mind would've invested. ETH was also almost uninfluenced by the Alliance news. the NEO pump also had nothing to do with Alibaba. meanwhile, Factom (just to give one example) has existed for as long as Eth, has real world applications and very solid business partners and yadda yadda yadda, and it has just barely reached 30$ these past few days. will it go higher? probably. but i'd be lying if i said \"100%\" because we all saw what happened in June\n\nwith your research, would you have guessed the BCH rally this month just because Koreans pumped it? did you predict the rise of Dash and Monero? or the fall of DNT after so much hype, even though it ticks pretty much every box for \"future success story\"? could you have predicted Monaco exploding to 20\u00d7 its price in less than a month, even though it's a vastly inferior product to TenX, a coin that's been stagnant for a while? no? thought so...\n\nseriously, dude. it's mostly luck. let's stop pretending it's anything else. the market is *extremely* volatile, and it's difficult to predict what news will affect the market and what won't and when. sometimes you can go by \"buy the rumour sell the news\", while other times \"the news\" won't make a difference. plus, there are soooo many of the smaller coins that are used for p&d schemes it's very risky to invest. perhaps when cryptos will become ubiquitous and mainstream, then some kind of Buffet-like value investing will be feasible, but right now...\n\njust my 0.02\u20ac",

A win for the good tech and punishment for bad.\n\nNope.\n\nthat news came up - of course it was a marketing move by that scam chain for companies to use private chains - surely, we thought, no one will actually think those companies will want any thing to do with public ethereum chain, this won't matter. well, we were correct about EEA companies having zero to do with public eth chain because its obviously unsecure and centralized. but we didn't expect how tech-illiterate and mentally deficient ethereum community has become after the exodus of all intelligent people and bought that up having little understanding of difference between public and private chains or difference between use and one of many experimental projects companies do. ICO's becoming popular was another sign of tech-illiteracy and became prime spot for targeting dumb money moon kids willing to trust strangers for projects unable to raise money via disciplined investors.\n\nwell, lessons we learned: fundamentals do not matter, crypto community is getting \"ethereumized\" i.e. dumber every day, and any news no matter how dumb and irrational is will probably create enormous profit.\n\n",

            "Because it doesn't rely on vague promises and marketing hype (paid ads, etc.). \n\nTake for example Monaco, it is skyrocketing awaiting the app release on August 31st which might or might not have \"VISA\" backing. All based on speculation up until now, but because of the promises, paid articles etc. the coin value is skyrocketing. It could either go down hard when alledged promises are not met or it could further grow if it does, but it's all speculation.\n\nVertcoin on the other hand has a dedicated team with solid tech behind it. It's time will come but it has a harder time proving itself because people need to build up more trust in it and it's not being marketed a lot. I strongly believe that the current value is the new baseline after the +1$ pump a few days back, with multiple articles/questions/etc. floating here on /CryptoCurrency. ",
            "Because it does nothing noteworthy, people will say it's asic resistant but if it was financially worthwhile I'm sure it could be overcome, then people will say atomic swaps and lightning network but vtc isn't the only coin eventually getting these upgrades decred is & I believe byteball is compatible too.

            "If you've been reading up on them you should know the risks.  I'd say the least risky is OMG, with DNT being (currently) the biggest risk.  I personally don't like ARK - but I didn't read their whitepaper thoroughly so I'm prepared to be wrong.  As far as I could tell it only rewards the top 51 holders, as only the top 51 get to forge ARK.  This means the devs and their friends and family are perhaps the only beneficiaries.  I gave up the moment I read that.  It's as bad as the 20% kickback that ZCash devs get.  \n\nSaying that, look at ZCash - the extremely controversial kickback to devs hasn't stopped that coin has it?  So ARK could be amazing.  However, I feel that for actual spending coins XMR and IOTA have pretty much got things covered.\n\nIt's your money, don't listen to me or anyone else.  The markets go against everything I think one day and the next everything goes as I thought.  Truth is almost every coin is going up overall.  You could literally invest with a blindfold on, go away for six months and you'll almost certainly have much more than you originally invested.\n\nOr you can sit there and stress all day, constantly checking how much each has gone up or down.  Wishing you'd put everything into Crown (old coin set to rise) instead.  Then feel depressed, and wake up one day having all but given up on your investment, only to click in and see that one of your investments has gone from 0.000050  to 0.154345  overnight - and you've got 50,000 of them, the other has gone from .0064234  to .0843454 - suddenly the world lights up for you.\n",
            "Of course it's legit! This is the [CTO's explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQPmwWhnfSs) of Hcash on their own Youtube channel. It doesn't get any more solid than this:\n\n> Thanks Sam. You mentioned the 7 H's and I will go quickly over them. One of them is quantum resistance which is Hcash will be using the algoritm what will be post quantum resistance. Hcash will be using features from the best currencies in the market. Like the Zcash it will be using the zero knowledge protocol. For instance, it would be using the messaging and encryption of the messages from the example of what Byteball is using to chat. It will be a hive between the currencies so it will be a gateway between all the blockbase and blockless blockchain and then it will talk at the same time and interact with the tangle as well which is IOTA is based on top of it. So this is the hybrid currency that will live forever in this ecosystem and then interact seamlessly and without any enforce of all these existing technologies on the blockchain using its security and then its protection that will stay with it.\n\nI'm not kidding or being selective, this is word for word how he explained it.\n\nTheir business development director has no profile at all on the internet. No LinkedIn page or any other profile. Must be hard developing a business if business partners cannot check out who they're dealing with? In the video he has to check his notes to sum up his education and experience.\n\nTheir [github](https://github.com/HyperCash/Hcash) repository is completely empty. As is their [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mkthcash/) page, [Reddit account](https://www.reddit.com/user/H_cash/) and other social media links.\n\nI don't know if it's a scam but it sure smells like it. These guys absolutely don't seem to know what they're talking about.",
            "There is literally multiple examples of this. U could say ltc is a competitor to btc, monero and zcash, etheruem and dozens of coins out there that offer assets, etc. Very broad range of coins.",
