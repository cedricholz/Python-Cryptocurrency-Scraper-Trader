The browser needs work, the amount of bugs that it currently has is staggering. Considering that it is going to try and compete with Google Chrome, it has to be flawless and marketed out the wazoo. When you look at the population as a whole, I don't see average people making the switch. Chrome is the default browser on all Android phones and a majority of people are okay with that or don't even really know that they have options. Even Mozilla Firefox which is arguably the second most popular browser, is miles behind Chrome in popularity and usage. I don't see the population making the switch because people don't like change.

            "Just personal speculation, but to me, bat as a coin is only investment worthy if the browser actually becomes a player in the common browsers for most users of the internet. I believe that Chrome will have a strong hold as the google product necessary to reach the internet for a while to come, as well as Safari for mac users and internet explorer for those who are not internet savvy.  \n\nI personally do not see BAT as a browser becoming mainstream, even if it does pay you for the adds, considering that for a while most people, as in 99% of the world, do not know how, or even care, to dabble in crypto currencies.  It's like a bank offering you X amount of $ to sign up for a checking account linked to direct deposit. Most people follow the \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" rule, and I believe the internet is another one of those things.\n\nI believe that those who dabble in crypto are up to receive coins for certain ads, but I don't ever see BAT being a huge player in terms of their product captivating audiences, seeing as their \"payout\" for using their product is in a currency that most don't know how to use.\n\nThat being said, in terms of crypto and strictly those who know how to go about trading and using said coins, the market is definitely there and people do use their internet browser, so it's all speculation in terms of main stream adoption.",

If they are not too restrictive, there won't be an incentive to switch to another browser or chrome addon (brave addon). (Noone really cares for earning pennys for watching ads, and the majoritiy does not care for a more fair distribution between publishers and big networks like google). \n\n\nLets say users really want to pay for content, there is another competitor aside from the simple paypal donation button: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr1eNMq9aDI\nWildspark by synereo will create a micropayment system which can be embedded where content was created.\nBut this project however won't hurt BAT",

            "Reporting it as income would require disclosing your exact BTC holdings to the IRS.  I think thats the kind of thing that could result is some serious legal challenges.  \n\nFor example if Satoshi happens to be a US citizen would he be required to reveal himself and claim a million Bitcoin Cash as income on his tax return despite never having sold any of those coins?  \n\nIf I owned a single 25 BTC physical coin that I bought for $50 or so back in the day am I required to crack it open and sell off enough to cover the tax?  Same deal if I mined coins years ago that I have never sold.\n\nWhat if Bitcoin Cash dies before the end of the year does everyone who had bitcoins at the time of the split just owe a shit load of tax anyway.  You can't write off the loss if you can't sell it.  \n\nI sat with my tax guy for a few hours talking about this and a few other crypto issues and I don't think this is a likely outcome.  Not to give the IRS the benefit of thinking they will make the sane choice, but there are just so many issues with doing it that way.  Where if they just consider it something more less gifted to you for free with 0 basis it's pretty simple to deal with.\n\n",

I'd just keep an eye out for downward trends and cash out. I haven't been a fan of ETH since they broke their \"immutable\" contract with DAO, and they keep adding features, trying to be all things to all people. You have only 6.9% and I think it can still make money short term, but it's another one I'd keep an eye on. Some of those smaller ones I don't know about. But overall, that looks solid."

            "A blockchain is blocks that are linked together. Think of each block as a piece of paper with records of transactions. This block is sealed using cryptography by creating a one way hash. If the data were altered in that block, it would not match the hash so it would be invalid. Each block has a reference to the previous block which is the previous blocks hash. Thus creating the chain. It is basically a super secure  (cannot be altered) ledger. The difference between coins are algorithms, and features they implement  (like privacy).\n\nI'm crypto, there are a few types of coins. Currency (bitcoin, litecoin, monero,dash). platform (ethereum, neo, tezos, eos,ark,ardor, waves, lisk). Application (gambling, distributed compute, even a VR second life type game where you buy land and build whatever you want on your plot).\n\nNow there is another technology important in this space called smart contracts. That is basically an automated way to transfer funds when something happens. An example of this is renting out your cpu. I'm a statistician but I don't have large processing power. I can use a dApp  (decentralized application) to submit my numbers to crunch, and other people's processing power does the work for me. I paid 1 coin to do this so that 1 coin is split between the miners. There are distributed compute products out there already (Golem, elastic), I'm not sure if that's exactly how they work. Just an example.\n\nRead whitepapers. For real. It's a lot of work and you'll probably have trouble understanding the technology or value in it, but that's how you pick the long term winners with big gains. On the other hand, this market is very unreasonable, especially when you consider virtually all the money coming in is speculation and not use of any products. My point is, people will throw money at hype, so keep your ear to the ground and try to ride the hype wave if you can.\n\nWatch the order books. You can see how much buy/sell pressure there is. Large sell walls mean the price is either steady or going to fall soon. That's because when a sell happens, it is sold to the highest bidder,  say $10. Then the sell price is at the next highest bidder, $9. So if someone has a sell order of $50k, the buyers may not break through that. Also, other sellers will need to post a lower asking price to dump their coins. Be wary of these walls though, whales will use them to manipulate the price, and they can be very good at doing so. If you see constantly moving walls, that's provably a whale.\n\nFinally, take this with a grain of salt. These are all things I've noticed/learned and I certainly haven't made millions in crypto. Have made a few grand though. Ymmv.",

Maybe even a $100 - I mean Bitcoin is worth over $4000 so it's possible.\"\n\nBut then you look at the coins in circulation which is 2.6 billion.  2.6 billion times 0.13 cents brings you to the current market cap of $350 million.\n\nSo, let's see what happens to the market cap if it the coin value reaches your hoped for highs:\n\n* At $1.30, the market cap becomes $3.5 billion.  That's position #3 and worth more than Litecoin.  Is that possible? I don't know much about Bitshares but Litecoin is a pretty solid coin with high adoption.\n\n* At $10, the market cap becomes over $30 billion dollars.  That's about the value of Ethereum.  Is that likely? \n\n* At $100, the market cap becomes over $300 billion dollars.  That's more than three times the total worth of Bitcoin.\n\nAgain, I don't know much about Bitshares but it looks pretty unlikely to me that it would be worth more than Bitcoin.

            "A blockchain is blocks that are linked together. Think of each block as a piece of paper with records of transactions. This block is sealed using cryptography by creating a one way hash. If the data were altered in that block, it would not match the hash so it would be invalid. Each block has a reference to the previous block which is the previous blocks hash. Thus creating the chain. It is basically a super secure  (cannot be altered) ledger. The difference between coins are algorithms, and features they implement  (like privacy).\n\nI'm crypto, there are a few types of coins. Currency (bitcoin, litecoin, monero,dash). platform (ethereum, neo, tezos, eos,ark,ardor, waves, lisk). Application (gambling, distributed compute, even a VR second life type game where you buy land and build whatever you want on your plot).\n\nNow there is another technology important in this space called smart contracts. That is basically an automated way to transfer funds when something happens. An example of this is renting out your cpu. I'm a statistician but I don't have large processing power. I can use a dApp  (decentralized application) to submit my numbers to crunch, and other people's processing power does the work for me. I paid 1 coin to do this so that 1 coin is split between the miners. There are distributed compute products out there already (Golem, elastic), I'm not sure if that's exactly how they work. Just an example.\n\nRead whitepapers. For real. It's a lot of work and you'll probably have trouble understanding the technology or value in it, but that's how you pick the long term winners with big gains. On the other hand, this market is very unreasonable, especially when you consider virtually all the money coming in is speculation and not use of any products. My point is, people will throw money at hype, so keep your ear to the ground and try to ride the hype wave if you can.\n\nWatch the order books. You can see how much buy/sell pressure there is. Large sell walls mean the price is either steady or going to fall soon. That's because when a sell happens, it is sold to the highest bidder,  say $10. Then the sell price is at the next highest bidder, $9. So if someone has a sell order of $50k, the buyers may not break through that. Also, other sellers will need to post a lower asking price to dump their coins. Be wary of these walls though, whales will use them to manipulate the price, and they can be very good at doing so. If you see constantly moving walls, that's provably a whale.\n\nFinally, take this with a grain of salt. These are all things I've noticed/learned and I certainly haven't made millions in crypto. Have made a few grand though. Ymmv.",

Who do we have to convince to keep this momentum going? Should we try to explain the blockchain to our Grandmas?\n\nFurthermore, how is mass adoption possible when nobody here wants to spend their fixed-supply Dash or Bitcoin on things like toothbrushes and coffee? We're all hodling for new cars and early retirement. \n\nHow can we expect mass adoption as a currency if everyone will hoard it? Why would businesses want to accept a currency that discourages spending?

They're attempting to be the Bloomberg Terminal of the crypto world. Definitely see the use-case as it's difficult to find information about different cryptocurrencies from a centralized location.  \n* IOTA: No fees, network gets faster the more people use it.

Maybe even a $100 - I mean Bitcoin is worth over $4000 so it's possible.\"\n\nBut then you look at the coins in circulation which is 2.6 billion.  2.6 billion times 0.13 cents brings you to the current market cap of $350 million.\n\nSo, let's see what happens to the market cap if it the coin value reaches your hoped for highs:\n\n* At $1.30, the market cap becomes $3.5 billion.  That's position #3 and worth more than Litecoin.  Is that possible? I don't know much about Bitshares but Litecoin is a pretty solid coin with high adoption.\n\n* At $10, the market cap becomes over $30 billion dollars.  That's about the value of Ethereum.  Is that likely? \n\n* At $100, the market cap becomes over $300 billion dollars.  That's more than three times the total worth of Bitcoin.\n\nAgain, I don't know much about Bitshares but it looks pretty unlikely to me that it would be worth more than Bitcoin.

            "A blockchain is blocks that are linked together. Think of each block as a piece of paper with records of transactions. This block is sealed using cryptography by creating a one way hash. If the data were altered in that block, it would not match the hash so it would be invalid. Each block has a reference to the previous block which is the previous blocks hash. Thus creating the chain. It is basically a super secure  (cannot be altered) ledger. The difference between coins are algorithms, and features they implement  (like privacy).\n\nI'm crypto, there are a few types of coins. Currency (bitcoin, litecoin, monero,dash). platform (ethereum, neo, tezos, eos,ark,ardor, waves, lisk). Application (gambling, distributed compute, even a VR second life type game where you buy land and build whatever you want on your plot).\n\nNow there is another technology important in this space called smart contracts. That is basically an automated way to transfer funds when something happens. An example of this is renting out your cpu. I'm a statistician but I don't have large processing power. I can use a dApp  (decentralized application) to submit my numbers to crunch, and other people's processing power does the work for me. I paid 1 coin to do this so that 1 coin is split between the miners. There are distributed compute products out there already (Golem, elastic), I'm not sure if that's exactly how they work. Just an example.\n\nRead whitepapers. For real. It's a lot of work and you'll probably have trouble understanding the technology or value in it, but that's how you pick the long term winners with big gains. On the other hand, this market is very unreasonable, especially when you consider virtually all the money coming in is speculation and not use of any products. My point is, people will throw money at hype, so keep your ear to the ground and try to ride the hype wave if you can.\n\nWatch the order books. You can see how much buy/sell pressure there is. Large sell walls mean the price is either steady or going to fall soon. That's because when a sell happens, it is sold to the highest bidder,  say $10. Then the sell price is at the next highest bidder, $9. So if someone has a sell order of $50k, the buyers may not break through that. Also, other sellers will need to post a lower asking price to dump their coins. Be wary of these walls though, whales will use them to manipulate the price, and they can be very good at doing so. If you see constantly moving walls, that's provably a whale.\n\nFinally, take this with a grain of salt. These are all things I've noticed/learned and I certainly haven't made millions in crypto. Have made a few grand though. Ymmv.",

In my opinion their future plans are simply brilliant and they have always followed their white paper carefully.

(xmr uses ringct), trusted setup (lol)?, ico vs fair distribution?\n\nico = bad distribution = PoS security risk since coins directly affect security\n\nI see nothing about no fees on it which won't make sense since you have to protect against sybil attacks in some way, and there are some experimental ways in some coins, but I see nothing like that here. I'm sure since it's not used heavily the fees are just low or the blocks aren't full so there's no concern about prioritizing transaction until it's heavier used - the case with most altcoins.\n\nFees are a solution to a problem of how to avoid requiring infinite bandwidth to validate nodes which is a security risk - blocksize limit needs a way to prioritize tx - they are normally fees. xmr uses adjustable blocksize automatically changing to account for increases or decreases to keep it secure and on small size but still needs fees\n\nzerocash and pivx required trusted setup, so they are not an option for trustless crypto.\n\nxspec has zeroknowledge proofs so it also required trusted setup and thus not an option for trustless crypto https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1704473.0\n\nperpetual 5% yearly inflation is much higher than [xmr's plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monero_\\(cryptocurrency\\)) of < 0.87%. \n\noh god it has a rich list LOL https://chainz.cryptoid.info/xspec/#!rich\n\nfor comparison, this is xmr rich list: http://moneroblocks.info/richlist (it's literally impossible)\n\nFew more things like we're not entirely sure PoS3 is secure against double spend attacks and nothing at stake issue PoW solves elegantly. Other forms of PoS might be better, but it's debatable and hasn't been tested properly.\n\nI guess point is: probably more to read",

One of the best funded projects in the space and with a fast growing roster of developers. \n\nWhen good to go it should be an all in one package for any one with basic computer knowledge to create a simple blockchain application. \n\nThey are working with Taikonauten to rebrand Lisk with a more corporate image. These guys have put out some really clean and fresh looking work for some big companies in the past so it should be good. \n\nAlso have an interest in RISE, a similar approach looking to create \"the WIX of the blockchain\" making it easy to drag and drop and create dApps. \n\nMuch smaller development team and no where near the level of funding that Lisk has, they have recently performed a chain swap from pure Lisk code to Shift-Ark hybrid.",

            "A blockchain is blocks that are linked together. Think of each block as a piece of paper with records of transactions. This block is sealed using cryptography by creating a one way hash. If the data were altered in that block, it would not match the hash so it would be invalid. Each block has a reference to the previous block which is the previous blocks hash. Thus creating the chain. It is basically a super secure  (cannot be altered) ledger. The difference between coins are algorithms, and features they implement  (like privacy).\n\nI'm crypto, there are a few types of coins. Currency (bitcoin, litecoin, monero,dash). platform (ethereum, neo, tezos, eos,ark,ardor, waves, lisk). Application (gambling, distributed compute, even a VR second life type game where you buy land and build whatever you want on your plot).\n\nNow there is another technology important in this space called smart contracts. That is basically an automated way to transfer funds when something happens. An example of this is renting out your cpu. I'm a statistician but I don't have large processing power. I can use a dApp  (decentralized application) to submit my numbers to crunch, and other people's processing power does the work for me. I paid 1 coin to do this so that 1 coin is split between the miners. There are distributed compute products out there already (Golem, elastic), I'm not sure if that's exactly how they work. Just an example.\n\nRead whitepapers. For real. It's a lot of work and you'll probably have trouble understanding the technology or value in it, but that's how you pick the long term winners with big gains. On the other hand, this market is very unreasonable, especially when you consider virtually all the money coming in is speculation and not use of any products. My point is, people will throw money at hype, so keep your ear to the ground and try to ride the hype wave if you can.\n\nWatch the order books. You can see how much buy/sell pressure there is. Large sell walls mean the price is either steady or going to fall soon. That's because when a sell happens, it is sold to the highest bidder,  say $10. Then the sell price is at the next highest bidder, $9. So if someone has a sell order of $50k, the buyers may not break through that. Also, other sellers will need to post a lower asking price to dump their coins. Be wary of these walls though, whales will use them to manipulate the price, and they can be very good at doing so. If you see constantly moving walls, that's provably a whale.\n\nFinally, take this with a grain of salt. These are all things I've noticed/learned and I certainly haven't made millions in crypto. Have made a few grand though. Ymmv.",
            "So I bought a Bitcoin back in 2013 on a whim for 300 bucks and pretty much forgot about it. Really wish I had been buying in for a small amount monthly since then..\n\nI already have my 401k and Roth maxed so I decided to use my fun money to buy into crypto. This chart represents a total buy in of 7K. From here on out I have $600 a month to invest.\n\nSo far I got really lucky with Monero and Lisk. Got my Monero for ~50 and Lisk for ~2. "

            "A blockchain is blocks that are linked together. Think of each block as a piece of paper with records of transactions. This block is sealed using cryptography by creating a one way hash. If the data were altered in that block, it would not match the hash so it would be invalid. Each block has a reference to the previous block which is the previous blocks hash. Thus creating the chain. It is basically a super secure  (cannot be altered) ledger. The difference between coins are algorithms, and features they implement  (like privacy).\n\nI'm crypto, there are a few types of coins. Currency (bitcoin, litecoin, monero,dash). platform (ethereum, neo, tezos, eos,ark,ardor, waves, lisk). Application (gambling, distributed compute, even a VR second life type game where you buy land and build whatever you want on your plot).\n\nNow there is another technology important in this space called smart contracts. That is basically an automated way to transfer funds when something happens. An example of this is renting out your cpu. I'm a statistician but I don't have large processing power. I can use a dApp  (decentralized application) to submit my numbers to crunch, and other people's processing power does the work for me. I paid 1 coin to do this so that 1 coin is split between the miners. There are distributed compute products out there already (Golem, elastic), I'm not sure if that's exactly how they work. Just an example.\n\nRead whitepapers. For real. It's a lot of work and you'll probably have trouble understanding the technology or value in it, but that's how you pick the long term winners with big gains. On the other hand, this market is very unreasonable, especially when you consider virtually all the money coming in is speculation and not use of any products. My point is, people will throw money at hype, so keep your ear to the ground and try to ride the hype wave if you can.\n\nWatch the order books. You can see how much buy/sell pressure there is. Large sell walls mean the price is either steady or going to fall soon. That's because when a sell happens, it is sold to the highest bidder,  say $10. Then the sell price is at the next highest bidder, $9. So if someone has a sell order of $50k, the buyers may not break through that. Also, other sellers will need to post a lower asking price to dump their coins. Be wary of these walls though, whales will use them to manipulate the price, and they can be very good at doing so. If you see constantly moving walls, that's provably a whale.\n\nFinally, take this with a grain of salt. These are all things I've noticed/learned and I certainly haven't made millions in crypto. Have made a few grand though. Ymmv.",
            "Looks good. I'd reinvest BCH back into OMG, maybe some NEO.  The news that mining BTC is 250% more profitable than BCH may drop BCH past any support it has. Possibly irreversible. \n\nOMG and NEO are bound to boom they're both 100% solid. Maybe zrx as a moon.",
            "This is pretty solid.  And safe.  I'd consider some NEO and LTC to be honest.  If you want to gamble, you can put some in XRP and DNT.  I think monero percentage is a bit high - that may be to the recent surge though, but overall very solid.  Honestly, you're doing great -- don't listen to anyone on here unless they have some good reasoning.  Keep it up!"

            "As Lithuanian I am skeptical myself and would advise not to invest in this ico. Here are my reasons :\n\n1. It's basically a currency with review system. It would be easy to implement on other coins if such idea would gain traction. Monetha itself doesn't offer new technology or at least don't disclose yet.\n2. smart contracts. They simply don't release them. It's ok to be secretive but it's not ok to blindly ask to give millions without proof of work. They may have it or they may not.\n\n3. Justas Pikelis Co-Founder/Business. The one with the slick and sexy haircut is \"enterpreneur\" and somewhat interesting person. At first, he was DJ, after that he became the entrepreneur and had a lawsuit with some company that they allegedly stole his idea and now feeling that he can gain easy money from ico he became Blockchain Entrepreneur. The rest team may be good but I simply don't believe in such fast transition from DJ to blockchain businessman. Here are some photos of him than he was DJ :\nhttp://www.delfi.lt/veidai/zmones/didzeju-justin-beat-labiausiai-zeidzia-kalbos-kad-jo-kunas-pripumpuotas-steroidu.d?id=63232736\nHe may look better than vitalik but I doubt he is better than him\n\nOverall monetha doesn't offer anything unique what couldn't be achieved with pre existing currencies and wide adoption of monetha is unlikely \n\n",
            "Ok, let's say you look at Bitshares (I'm picking this almost at random - it may be a great coin or a terrible one - I don't know much about it).

Maybe even a $100 - I mean Bitcoin is worth over $4000 so it's possible.\"\n\nBut then you look at the coins in circulation which is 2.6 billion.  2.6 billion times 0.13 cents brings you to the current market cap of $350 million.\n\nSo, let's see what happens to the market cap if it the coin value reaches your hoped for highs:\n\n* At $1.30, the market cap becomes $3.5 billion.  That's position #3 and worth more than Litecoin.  Is that possible? I don't know much about Bitshares but Litecoin is a pretty solid coin with high adoption.\n\n* At $10, the market cap becomes over $30 billion dollars.  That's about the value of Ethereum.  Is that likely? \n\n* At $100, the market cap becomes over $300 billion dollars.  That's more than three times the total worth of Bitcoin.\n\nAgain, I don't know much about Bitshares but it looks pretty unlikely to me that it would be worth more than Bitcoin.  Or Ethereum for that matter.\n",

Or do i have to download seperate wallets for some coins? Also will I be losing some money by fees everytime i transfer? "

It is basically an immutable data layer on which applications can be built, factom Inc mostly focusses on getting their product done but once they start advertising and bringing in the big financial and mortgage firms it will be unstoppable. In my opinion their future plans are simply brilliant and they have always followed their white paper carefully. This protocol can take away corruption, fraud, and money spent on accounting and auditing, which I think has a mind blowing value.\n\nI believe in this project more than any other, including the ones that already proved themselves.",
            "I'm taking the opportunity to make use of the ambiguity of the question, and want to mention technologies that aren't a conventional product, but are using the Blockchain and crypto technology - or are inspired by it - to take the internet to the next level, towards a more structured landscape of decentralized platforms, embodying the idea of distributed value and trust/legitimacy beyond a simple product. Basically a vision like that of Berners-Lee (inventor of the world wide web) and others who're brainstorming on the future of the internet, and how it can actually become positively intertwined and beneficial with/to society's development. \n \nSo I'm really excited about projects that resonate with that vision. I stumbled upon [Ananas](https://www.ananas.org.uk) and keep an eye open for similar projects. Looking at it I think they're still in the very early stages, but feel like they do have a very good vision and would love to see more stuff like it. Hopefully it's not too unclear what I mean, and someone can point me to similar things that have a real potential benefit to society on a larger scale.\n \nWhat they do specifically  is a totally new way at fulfilling a societal need that at the moment is centralized in for-profit organizations, in Ananas' case the creation, integration, and development of subjective knowledge within the confines of a dedicated platform. \n \nMaybe it's because I'm just so sick and tired of the constant misinformation in the world, and absolute lack of clarity on how to deal with this as a society. Don't get me wrong, some news organisations and projects are doing their best changing the way we get news and learn about the world, but in the end they're all limited in one way or another.\n \nI used to be a Dawkins-esque militant atheist, but then a christian friend changed my mind. I'm still agnostic, and very aware of the flaws of religion, but also how I dont think religion and spirituality is ever going to disappear from society. In fact, I think it's aways going to be human nature to desire something of a meta narrative. Might as well provide a good place for it to develop right? Safe from bias, distortion, and ensuring it'll develop in alignment with universal values. \n \nThe plan seems to  be to use a token coin as its native currency to fuel incentives and collaborative development, through social engineering and what I guess can be described as a hybrid (Artificial and human) intelligence to create a virtual dataset of collective knowledge. \n \nSometimes I see an ICO where I feel like either the use of token is unnecessary, or that it just takes one competitor to demolish the potential value of that token. I just really feel like there should be more stuff like this, where a token is tied to a platform that provides societal value and symbolizes  decentralized trust and value in different forms (legitimacy of knowledge/info, mutual understanding, and value of open knowledge in the case of Ananas), so please, if you know something similar or plan on doing a start-up, let me know. \n \nNot saying the other stuff out there isn't valuable, quite a lot of it is, just kinda hoping the crypto/blockchain movement is gonna mature to something greater.",

            "I'm taking the opportunity to make use of the ambiguity of the question, and want to mention technologies that aren't a conventional product, but are using the Blockchain and crypto technology - or are inspired by it - to take the internet to the next level, towards a more structured landscape of decentralized platforms, embodying the idea of distributed value and trust/legitimacy beyond a simple product. Basically a vision like that of Berners-Lee (inventor of the world wide web) and others who're brainstorming on the future of the internet, and how it can actually become positively intertwined and beneficial with/to society's development. \n \nSo I'm really excited about projects that resonate with that vision. I stumbled upon [Ananas](https://www.ananas.org.uk) and keep an eye open for similar projects. Looking at it I think they're still in the very early stages, but feel like they do have a very good vision and would love to see more stuff like it. Hopefully it's not too unclear what I mean, and someone can point me to similar things that have a real potential benefit to society on a larger scale.\n \nWhat they do specifically  is a totally new way at fulfilling a societal need that at the moment is centralized in for-profit organizations, in Ananas' case the creation, integration, and development of subjective knowledge within the confines of a dedicated platform. \n \nMaybe it's because I'm just so sick and tired of the constant misinformation in the world, and absolute lack of clarity on how to deal with this as a society. Don't get me wrong, some news organisations and projects are doing their best changing the way we get news and learn about the world, but in the end they're all limited in one way or another.\n \nI used to be a Dawkins-esque militant atheist, but then a christian friend changed my mind. I'm still agnostic, and very aware of the flaws of religion, but also how I dont think religion and spirituality is ever going to disappear from society. In fact, I think it's aways going to be human nature to desire something of a meta narrative. Might as well provide a good place for it to develop right? Safe from bias, distortion, and ensuring it'll develop in alignment with universal values. \n \nThe plan seems to  be to use a token coin as its native currency to fuel incentives and collaborative development, through social engineering and what I guess can be described as a hybrid (Artificial and human) intelligence to create a virtual dataset of collective knowledge. \n \nSometimes I see an ICO where I feel like either the use of token is unnecessary, or that it just takes one competitor to demolish the potential value of that token. I just really feel like there should be more stuff like this, where a token is tied to a platform that provides societal value and symbolizes  decentralized trust and value in different forms (legitimacy of knowledge/info, mutual understanding, and value of open knowledge in the case of Ananas), so please, if you know something similar or plan on doing a start-up, let me know. \n \nNot saying the other stuff out there isn't valuable, quite a lot of it is, just kinda hoping the crypto/blockchain movement is gonna mature to something greater.",
            "I personally do not trust the banks, not because I think they are evil and stuff. To me they were just a necessity of our society and with developments we have found a better way. Crypto is the future but that doesn't mean everyone will make millions in it, so I get your fear.\n\nThe simple answer is to diversify into as many things as possible, if safety is your major concern.\n\nIn my country, as per my knowledge, the government only insures you for 1,00,000/- Rs for each bank account. So if you had 10 million in it, it wouldn't matter, you will only get 1,00,000/- if the bank belly ups.\n\nSo put some of your money in different banks, some in SIP's, some in mutual funds, some in assets and some in crypto. You can diversify even more within these, like have money in multiple SIP's, mutual funds, various assets and even different exchanges and wallets and coins.",
            "I agree it's a problem. Crypto puts the burden of security on the user. If you just want to store your funds, you can get near perfect security by using a paper wallet with backups and never entering your private key into an Internet connected device. \n\nI'm not sure 2fa is possible without extending your trust to some entity off the blockchain.",

And it's on a blockchain that can scale to MasterCard levels of tx/sec today - as in right now, not someday in the future when a scaling solution that may or may not work is developed. \n\nOther graphene chains - Peerplays, Muse, Steem, and Calibrae (a upcoming fork of STEEM that relieves whales who mined a shitload during the early hyperinflationary period of their advantage, placing those funds in the reward pool).\n\nMonero because fungibility. \n\nEOS because scalability.",

I'm sure since it's not used heavily the fees are just low or the blocks aren't full so there's no concern about prioritizing transaction until it's heavier used - the case with most altcoins.\n\nFees are a solution to a problem of how to avoid requiring infinite bandwidth to validate nodes which is a security risk - blocksize limit needs a way to prioritize tx - they are normally fees. xmr uses adjustable blocksize automatically changing to account for increases or decreases to keep it secure and on small size but still needs fees\n\nzerocash and pivx required trusted setup, so they are not an option for trustless crypto.\n\nxspec has zeroknowledge proofs so it also required trusted setup and thus not an option for trustless crypto https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1704473.0\n\nperpetual 5% yearly inflation is much higher than [xmr's plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monero_\\(cryptocurrency\\)) of < 0.87%. \n\noh god it has a rich list LOL https://chainz.cryptoid.info/xspec/#!rich\n\nfor comparison, this is xmr rich list: http://moneroblocks.info/richlist (it's literally impossible)\n\nFew more things like we're not entirely sure PoS3 is secure against double spend attacks and nothing at stake issue PoW solves elegantly. Other forms of PoS might be better, but it's debatable and hasn't been tested properly.\n\nI guess point is: probably more to read",

            "A blockchain is blocks that are linked together. Think of each block as a piece of paper with records of transactions. This block is sealed using cryptography by creating a one way hash. If the data were altered in that block, it would not match the hash so it would be invalid. Each block has a reference to the previous block which is the previous blocks hash. Thus creating the chain. It is basically a super secure  (cannot be altered) ledger. The difference between coins are algorithms, and features they implement  (like privacy).\n\nI'm crypto, there are a few types of coins. Currency (bitcoin, litecoin, monero,dash). platform (ethereum, neo, tezos, eos,ark,ardor, waves, lisk). Application (gambling, distributed compute, even a VR second life type game where you buy land and build whatever you want on your plot).\n\nNow there is another technology important in this space called smart contracts. That is basically an automated way to transfer funds when something happens. An example of this is renting out your cpu. I'm a statistician but I don't have large processing power. I can use a dApp  (decentralized application) to submit my numbers to crunch, and other people's processing power does the work for me. I paid 1 coin to do this so that 1 coin is split between the miners. There are distributed compute products out there already (Golem, elastic), I'm not sure if that's exactly how they work. Just an example.\n\nRead whitepapers. For real. It's a lot of work and you'll probably have trouble understanding the technology or value in it, but that's how you pick the long term winners with big gains. On the other hand, this market is very unreasonable, especially when you consider virtually all the money coming in is speculation and not use of any products. My point is, people will throw money at hype, so keep your ear to the ground and try to ride the hype wave if you can.\n\nWatch the order books. You can see how much buy/sell pressure there is. Large sell walls mean the price is either steady or going to fall soon. That's because when a sell happens, it is sold to the highest bidder,  say $10. Then the sell price is at the next highest bidder, $9. So if someone has a sell order of $50k, the buyers may not break through that. Also, other sellers will need to post a lower asking price to dump their coins. Be wary of these walls though, whales will use them to manipulate the price, and they can be very good at doing so. If you see constantly moving walls, that's provably a whale.\n\nFinally, take this with a grain of salt. These are all things I've noticed/learned and I certainly haven't made millions in crypto. Have made a few grand though. Ymmv.",
            "So I bought a Bitcoin back in 2013 on a whim for 300 bucks and pretty much forgot about it.

This chart represents a total buy in of 7K. From here on out I have $600 a month to invest.\n\nSo far I got really lucky with Monero and Lisk. Got my Monero for ~50 and Lisk for ~2. ",
