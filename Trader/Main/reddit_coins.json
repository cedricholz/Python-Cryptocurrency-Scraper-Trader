            ">It is unlikely that bitcoin will be used as the main currency for making purchases, simply because an average single confirmation time of 5 minutes (assuming your transaction occurs in the next block) is too slow for personal to business transactions. \n\nYou forgot to mention bitcoin smart contracts, faster sidechains including one with all capabilities of ethereum with its own lightning network and without the security issues of eth, enormous amount of lightning network work near finalized, other layer 2 solutions.\n\nIt's very misleading to pretend the most developed blockchain in existence is not going to do scaling. I suggest reading more than factually inaccurate subreddits like censored ethereum ones.

Those years look like normal growth actually. \nEven the 2008 crisis had a much smaller effect on the price (% wise) than the 99 crash.\n\nIt also provides a much clearer look on the theory that the author touches upon. Progression of a development is linear, but price swings around this progression trend in exponential ranges.\n\nTo see for yourself, go to www.tradingview.com and open the amazon chart. Set to weekly and log scale. \n"

            "I can't wait! I've got a couple of questions about GRS.",

If you like one but not the other, then don\u2019t have any part in it.  When you take into account all the awful coins out there that will not make it, there\u2019s definitely room for both of these coins to flourish.  It\u2019s not tug o\u2019 war.",
            "GRS may or may not be a good coin but the GRS Super Shill Squad is gonna ruin any chance of it being big, ppl already see GRS in a negative light because of them. At least the pump from 3k to 9k tripled my VTC bags so im thankful to GRS for that",
            "why does GRS have multiple wallets instead of one official one for each platform, how are they gonna manage all those wallets? Seems like a wasteful use of resources. Also what is their roadmap? What is their Vision?. VTC is the people's coin with a roadmap to show for that. All GRS does is 3-4 updates per year and they don't even tell you what they are updating til it comes out",

Bitcoin Gold had nothing to do with VTC or GRS, it had to do with the fact that the tech is in demand and some people wanted to use that as a cash grab. As it stands, that drew attention to Asic Resistance which shed light on an under represented MKT segment. It happens to be that both coins are Segwit active coins and that just so happens to be the next tfork. So yeah, your opinion is something you are entitled to but I disagree. Crypto is still so new, its going to take time for the market to call forward the coins that matter forward for them to run and gain the mkt caps they deserve.",

They are **THE ONLY** coin to have non stop steady growth without any major dips in price. Whoever created it is genius. Also they have had a bigger percentage growth than almost any coin including ETH and NEO. I\u2019m not even invested in BItconnect but it\u2019s just sad to see people so jealous. Get a life. Who cares if it\u2019s a Ponzi scheme if it makes you money and it\u2019s successful. Not one piece of evidence has come out to prove that it\u2019s a scam and actually all evidence right now proves it\u2019s a strong long term crypto.\n\nBy the way how it is a \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d?

It's about 7% yearly dividends for keeping it off an exchange & you don't have to stake/lock wallet like most other cryptos, which most of those coins are only offering 5% annual returns. Ark delegate voting hasn't given me the rates they're claiming to payout so next to SNGLS I think NEO is the best for passive income.",
            "Some of you guys haven\u2019t even transferred your NEO from one wallet to another yet. By far, NEO is the fastest crypto for that. Compared to OMG, ETH, LTC and especially BTC, NEO is light speeds faster (FYI I have stakes in all of those aforementioned coins). Yes I know they had down time a couple days ago when releasing this years 15 million supply tokens. Yes some wallets have sync issues (if you follow the tutorials you\u2019re usually okay). But if we\u2019re going to use NEO as a form of real time currency, there\u2019s few that can compete. We\u2019ll see how plasma benefits OMG/ETH though.",

That's WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too much. \n\nHalf of the total supply is developer controlled(!) That is unheard of greed. No matter how you try to paint it. Make them cut supply by 35 million by destroying them. At that point they'd still control too many coins but at least it would be somewhat reasonable.

Therefore, we decide to officially launch the NEO sponsor giveback plan designed to unconditionally give back to the early sponsors in the amount equal to the fiat value they contributed back then...\n**The giveback comes from the remainder of the total funds raised during the seed-round financing, ICO1 and ICO2**. Initial sponsors may claim their respective portions either through bank transfer (in CNY only) or in NEO. For those who choose to claim the giveback in NEO, NEO Council will purchase NEO with the remaining funds. **The 50% NEO under the management of NEO Council will not be used for the giveback**, as it is reserved for the development of community and ecosystem.\"\n",

Bitcoin Gold had nothing to do with VTC or GRS, it had to do with the fact that the tech is in demand and some people wanted to use that as a cash grab. As it stands, that drew attention to Asic Resistance which shed light on an under represented MKT segment. It happens to be that both coins are Segwit active coins and that just so happens to be the next tfork. So yeah, your opinion is something you are entitled to but I disagree. Crypto is still so new, its going to take time for the market to call forward the coins that matter forward for them to run and gain the mkt caps they deserve.",
