I'm holding ARK long term and collecting the staking rewards, which for me right now equals about $800 local currency monthly. A really good traders profit for being \"retired\" I like to think. ",

            "Litecoin will wither when Bitcoin implements 2nd-layer scaling solutions...and if Bitcoin fails to do that, it'll go down hard, and Litecoin will wither under that circumstance, too.  All Litecoin is good for is riding Bitcoin's coattails and sweeping up those who are okay with BTC being a \"store of value\" that isn't functional as a transactional currency.  For now, speculation will keep driving it up, I'm holding some for that reason alone...but it's not a sound long-term play.\n\nARK is, IMO, somewhere between Ethereum and Ripple in terms of structure, ideology, and application.  SmartBridges, \"push-button\" blockchains for businesses, DPoS...its value will come from its utility in the services it provides to connect and deploy disparate blockchains.  DPoS incentivizes hodling, while SmartBridges could make the ARK coin a sort of universal blockchain token.  It's not really anyone's anarcho-capitalist revolution, but it strikes me as a better investment than a coin whose only claim to fame is being Bitcoin's cheeky little brother.",
            "Mine? \n\nIota Ark and NEO \n\nBut they all need A LOT of work before they ascend.\n\nArk needs its Smart contract environment to be up and running, it needs to be connected to more coins than just eth (and btc now!), it needs to become what it claims to be (an entry point to consumers who want to create their own natively bridged chains) using push button blockchains, and they seriously need, once they get that set, to pivot on their marketing philosophy into well... actually marketing.\n\nIota needs a better wallet, it needs to be easier to add to exchanges and it needs to eliminate its last shreds of centralization by getting to a point where coordinator nodes are no longer needed.\n\nNeo\u2019s needs to decentralize as well, to allow what antshares originally promised (that \u201cshares\u201d or NEO coins as they\u2019re known now don\u2019t just generate gas but allow voting too). The rest is out of Neo\u2019s hands to some degree as they need China\u2019s government to get its ducks in a row and tell us just what the fuck their policy is going to be going forward.\n\nIf these three coins can actually achieve these things I see no reason why they won\u2019t have positions in the top 10 for a very long time.\n\nHonorable mention is Monero, I didn\u2019t include it because I already think it\u2019s a top coin along with Btc, eth, and ltc."

I'm seeing astronomical gains next year because it has so many use cases from the smart contract perspective and the ETH alliance will be getting a lot of media coverage as these giant corporations start rolling out their own block chain apps built on ETH. \n\n- MOD, Vechain, Enjin, Ark.

I was hoping someone could shed some light on what decent buys currently and how to actually purchase these things. I dont understand the hold wallet, or how to go about this just yet. So if anyone could give some advice or guidance, it would be greatly appreciated. thank you!",

At what price do you have your buying orders and for what coin? \nI'm waiting for that cheap eth at 300-375 spread.\n\nI don't get how the market get's excited every time btc goes from 9.5 to 10.5. Wall's still intact. Zooming out you would expect 10.000 not to hold without an decent correction. Imo at least."

Even though Vitalik's vision is to focus on smart contracts, I see nothing is stopping it from entering the payment space. With proof of stake and Raiden in place, it will be far ahead of Bitcoin. On the other hand, no one seems to think of Ethereum as a method for day to day payment. Maybe it's the brand. ",

The community as a whole will gain a much larger awareness of the idea that your funds and transactions on standard blockchains are not at all hidden.\n\nI like a few privacy-oriented projects a lot now and for 2018:\n\n**XMR** - Big daddy in anonymous tech. The infrastructure is finally catching up to the network interest - hardware/mobile wallets, fiat exchanges, etc. Monero will be $1,000+ in 2018.\n\n**SUMO** - Monero's helpful little brother. SUMO is a Monero fork started in May 2017 that has shown a ton of progress and active development in a short timeframe. SUMO has already launched features like anonymous sub-addresses and anti-botnet code that have or will likely be added to Monero in the future. $2 million market cap right now. I expect that to grow quite a bit in 2018. [r/SumoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/SumoCurrency/) [r/sumokoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/sumokoin/)\n\n**AEON** - Mobile Monero. I believe AEON is waiting on mobile technology to catch up before it really starts to see development and takes off, and 2018 might be the year that happens. I think AEON will grow slowly through 2018 and catch fire sometime later in the year. [r/AEON](https://www.reddit.com/r/aeon/)\n\n**HUSH** - HUSH is the only Zcash based coin I like long term. HUSH removed the founders reward present in most other Z-coins. They have an ambitious roadmap including secure messaging and counterparty + ethereum virtual machine integration into the platform. The developers build open source and remind me of other qualified open source teams like Monero's and Ark's. I expect HUSH to grow steadily in 2018 as pieces of the roadmap are completed.

            "Litecoin will wither when Bitcoin implements 2nd-layer scaling solutions...and if Bitcoin fails to do that, it'll go down hard, and Litecoin will wither under that circumstance, too.  All Litecoin is good for is riding Bitcoin's coattails and sweeping up those who are okay with BTC being a \"store of value\" that isn't functional as a transactional currency.  For now, speculation will keep driving it up, I'm holding some for that reason alone...but it's not a sound long-term play.\n\nARK is, IMO, somewhere between Ethereum and Ripple in terms of structure, ideology, and application.  SmartBridges, \"push-button\" blockchains for businesses, DPoS...its value will come from its utility in the services it provides to connect and deploy disparate blockchains.  DPoS incentivizes hodling, while SmartBridges could make the ARK coin a sort of universal blockchain token.  It's not really anyone's anarcho-capitalist revolution, but it strikes me as a better investment than a coin whose only claim to fame is being Bitcoin's cheeky little brother.",

Beyond that, the Ethereum roadmap is exciting...transitioning to proof-of-stake, zk-SNARK integration for truly private and fungible transactions.  By some metrics the Ethereum blockchain also processes around 50% of all crypto transactions on a daily basis.  \n\nLTC is a good holding, too, as it's been on a slow but steady upward trajectory for a long time.  However, I'm not real bullish on it, because it's committed to being nothing more than a BTC epiphyte...it's not really trying to compete with BTC for anything and is only really useful if it can capitalize on BTC remaining slow and expensive to use.  Whenever BTC adopts Lightning Network, LTC will basically get kicked to the curb.\n\nBTC may keep appreciating, but the community is fragmented and seems to be focusing more energy on bad-mouthing Bitcoin Cash (BCH) than on solving their scaling issues.

            "Buy NEO, we are going to triple digits soon. A ton of ICOs starting on NEO in the near future. Many dapps now developing. This is the last chance in 2017 for making great investment. ",
            "NEO monthly report: Decentralization coming and international marketing stepping up",
            "Please help NEO get out of this hole.... :)",
            "Yeah, you are spot on.  Not to mention the environmental impact of PoW.  Look into Proof of Stake coins like NEO or distributed PoS like ARK.  ETH is going to PoS eventually too.  It is far easier to be a block validator (miner), is way more environmentally friendly, and I believe it is the future of crypto.",
            "you need a lot more NEO in your diet",
            "Move 5% from bitcoin to DRP and another 5% to NEO and you're golden."

Dash is a very questionable crypto, I remember researching it and realizing it's basically like a Ponzi scheme that needs new people buying in constantly. Augur I am just unfamiliar with. \n\nMy opinion on a few things:\n\n- ETH 2018, it's going to explode. I'm seeing astronomical gains next year because it has so many use cases from the smart contract perspective and the ETH alliance will be getting a lot of media coverage as these giant corporations start rolling out their own block chain apps built on ETH. \n\n- MOD, Vechain, Enjin, Ark. The sleepers that I believe will take off in 2018. Check them out. "

            "I've always wanted to get into mining but overall it just seems like too much work for the return. Instead of buying say 4 GTX 1080s which are fantastic for mining Vertcoin you might as well put that about $1600 into Vertcoin instead. You'll probably see greater returns with the latter.  Unless you have a powerful enough setup that can melt windows. You really aren't doing that well. ",

            "Litecoin will wither when Bitcoin implements 2nd-layer scaling solutions...and if Bitcoin fails to do that, it'll go down hard, and Litecoin will wither under that circumstance, too.  All Litecoin is good for is riding Bitcoin's coattails and sweeping up those who are okay with BTC being a \"store of value\" that isn't functional as a transactional currency.  For now, speculation will keep driving it up, I'm holding some for that reason alone...but it's not a sound long-term play.\n\nARK is, IMO, somewhere between Ethereum and Ripple in terms of structure, ideology, and application.  SmartBridges, \"push-button\" blockchains for businesses, DPoS...its value will come from its utility in the services it provides to connect and deploy disparate blockchains.  DPoS incentivizes hodling, while SmartBridges could make the ARK coin a sort of universal blockchain token.  It's not really anyone's anarcho-capitalist revolution, but it strikes me as a better investment than a coin whose only claim to fame is being Bitcoin's cheeky little brother."

            "I think privacy is a bit under-represented in your portfolio. 2018 is going to be the first year where quite a large group of people have to pay taxes on their financial gains through cryptocurrency. The community as a whole will gain a much larger awareness of the idea that your funds and transactions on standard blockchains are not at all hidden.\n\nI like a few privacy-oriented projects a lot now and for 2018:\n\n**XMR** - Big daddy in anonymous tech. The infrastructure is finally catching up to the network interest - hardware/mobile wallets, fiat exchanges, etc. Monero will be $1,000+ in 2018.\n\n**SUMO** - Monero's helpful little brother. SUMO is a Monero fork started in May 2017 that has shown a ton of progress and active development in a short timeframe. SUMO has already launched features like anonymous sub-addresses and anti-botnet code that have or will likely be added to Monero in the future. $2 million market cap right now. I expect that to grow quite a bit in 2018. [r/SumoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/SumoCurrency/) [r/sumokoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/sumokoin/)\n\n**AEON** - Mobile Monero. I believe AEON is waiting on mobile technology to catch up before it really starts to see development and takes off, and 2018 might be the year that happens. I think AEON will grow slowly through 2018 and catch fire sometime later in the year. [r/AEON](https://www.reddit.com/r/aeon/)\n\n**HUSH** - HUSH is the only Zcash based coin I like long term. HUSH removed the founders reward present in most other Z-coins. They have an ambitious roadmap including secure messaging and counterparty + ethereum virtual machine integration into the platform. The developers build open source and remind me of other qualified open source teams like Monero's and Ark's. I expect HUSH to grow steadily in 2018 as pieces of the roadmap are completed.
