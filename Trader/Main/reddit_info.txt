12 : 21:29:54 12/01/2017 : Mine? 

Iota Ark and NEO 

But they all need A LOT of work before they ascend.

Ark needs its Smart contract environment to be up and running, it needs to be connected to more coins than just eth (and btc now!), it needs to become what it claims to be (an entry point to consumers who want to create their own natively bridged chains) using push button blockchains, and they seriously need, once they get that set, to pivot on their marketing philosophy into well... actually marketing.

Iota needs a better wallet, it needs to be easier to add to exchanges and it needs to eliminate its last shreds of centralization by getting to a point where coordinator nodes are no longer needed.

Neo‚Äôs needs to decentralize as well, to allow what antshares originally promised (that ‚Äúshares‚Äù or NEO coins as they‚Äôre known now don‚Äôt just generate gas but allow voting too). The rest is out of Neo‚Äôs hands to some degree as they need China‚Äôs government to get its ducks in a row and tell us just what the fuck their policy is going to be going forward.

If these three coins can actually achieve these things I see no reason why they won‚Äôt have positions in the top 10 for a very long time.

Honorable mention is Monero, I didn‚Äôt include it because I already think it‚Äôs a top coin along with Btc, eth, and ltc.Sentiment: 0.19353479853479855

7 : 23:03:57 12/01/2017 : ARK is nice because you can vote for any of the top 51 delegates and earn more ARK (passive income). Something similar to how holding NEO rewards you with GAS. Sentiment: 0.4

4 : 16:06:37 12/01/2017 : i'm holding 11 coins, but BTC, LTC, and XMR make up 3/4s of my total portfolio.  1/2 of the remaining 25% is split evenly across 3 coins, OMG POWR, VTC. Ark takes a similar sized chunk out of the remaining 12.5%, with NEO, GRS, BTG (from the split), and XRP filling out the rest.

i'd say just hold out and see what rises to the top, but personally i like to have some "ballast" with a few "top tier" (entirely subjective) coins making up most of the total value.Sentiment: 0.14444444444444446

3 : 04:10:53 12/02/2017 : BTC growth will probably outpace litecoin. Many are predicting 4-5x growth next year. 

Ark will grow at a faster pace. They just established a business entity in EU, completed the Bitcoin listener and are soon releasing the mobile wallet. Next two quarters should see ark core 2.0 and ark VM which is when it'll start to explode. Additionally, the DPOS rewards are at 10% or something currently and over 60% of current supply is in wallets being stalked causing an increase in demand. I firmly believe ARK will 10x over the next year due to all these reasons.Sentiment: 0.021875

2 : 23:35:48 12/01/2017 : I don't dare predict price movements, but I'll just say what I have done. In order to "retire" from trading I wanted to just park all my crypto, like I had in ETH on its entire run up from single digit prices. I'm holding ARK long term and collecting the staking rewards, which for me right now equals about $800 local currency monthly. A really good traders profit for being "retired" I like to think.

1 : 23:02:26 12/01/2017 : Another "small question". Please correct me if I'm wrong. The idea is that in the future it will be possible to buy something with price in fiat using Ark Ecosystem? For example, I have BTC and would like to buy something in Amazon for $. Will ARK allow to do this too?Sentiment: -0.1875

1 : 05:35:54 12/02/2017 : Litecoin will wither when Bitcoin implements 2nd-layer scaling solutions...and if Bitcoin fails to do that, it'll go down hard, and Litecoin will wither under that circumstance, too.  All Litecoin is good for is riding Bitcoin's coattails and sweeping up those who are okay with BTC being a "store of value" that isn't functional as a transactional currency.  For now, speculation will keep driving it up, I'm holding some for that reason alone...but it's not a sound long-term play.

ARK is, IMO, somewhere between Ethereum and Ripple in terms of structure, ideology, and application.  SmartBridges, "push-button" blockchains for businesses, DPoS...its value will come from its utility in the services it provides to connect and deploy disparate blockchains.  DPoS incentivizes hodling, while SmartBridges could make the ARK coin a sort of universal blockchain token.  It's not really anyone's anarcho-capitalist revolution, but it strikes me as a better investment than a coin whose only claim to fame is being Bitcoin's cheeky little brother.Sentiment: 0.024116161616161612

3 : 22:48:55 12/01/2017 : I think privacy is a bit under-represented in your portfolio. 2018 is going to be the first year where quite a large group of people have to pay taxes on their financial gains through cryptocurrency. The community as a whole will gain a much larger awareness of the idea that your funds and transactions on standard blockchains are not at all hidden.

I like a few privacy-oriented projects a lot now and for 2018:

**XMR** - Big daddy in anonymous tech. The infrastructure is finally catching up to the network interest - hardware/mobile wallets, fiat exchanges, etc. Monero will be $1,000+ in 2018.

**SUMO** - Monero's helpful little brother. SUMO is a Monero fork started in May 2017 that has shown a ton of progress and active development in a short timeframe. SUMO has already launched features like anonymous sub-addresses and anti-botnet code that have or will likely be added to Monero in the future. $2 million market cap right now. I expect that to grow quite a bit in 2018. [r/SumoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/SumoCurrency/) [r/sumokoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/sumokoin/)

**AEON** - Mobile Monero. I believe AEON is waiting on mobile technology to catch up before it really starts to see development and takes off, and 2018 might be the year that happens. I think AEON will grow slowly through 2018 and catch fire sometime later in the year. [r/AEON](https://www.reddit.com/r/aeon/)

**HUSH** - HUSH is the only Zcash based coin I like long term. HUSH removed the founders reward present in most other Z-coins. They have an ambitious roadmap including secure messaging and counterparty + ethereum virtual machine integration into the platform. The developers build open source and remind me of other qualified open source teams like Monero's and Ark's. I expect HUSH to grow steadily in 2018 as pieces of the roadmap are completed.

2 : 18:07:18 12/01/2017 : It depends if ETH plans to enter the payment business or not. Without it, I think it's hard for it to become a trillion dollar crypto. Even though Vitalik's vision is to focus on smart contracts, I see nothing is stopping it from entering the payment space. With proof of stake and Raiden in place, it will be far ahead of Bitcoin. On the other hand, no one seems to think of Ethereum as a method for day to day payment. Maybe it's the brand. Sentiment: -0.0255952380952381

2 : 19:08:05 12/01/2017 : Sorry for the very noob question, but I am in fact a noob. Is Ethereum a worthwhile investement at this point, or should we be exclusively riding the wave of BTC? (Speaking as someone who recently bought BTC at 10k and has not bought any Ethereum. Sentiment: 0.05

1 : 16:35:29 12/01/2017 : Re: Ethereum & Casper

What happens to the blocks (and the transactions in them) on a forked chain that won't become the longest chain? Will the blockchain simply have one long chain with many small chains (that eventually end) attached at various blocks? If so, are those small forks still part of the 'blockchain' even though it not the longest chain?Sentiment: -0.008333333333333331

1 : 04:58:38 12/02/2017 : If you're a relatively small-time investor looking to sink $100-$200 a month into a crypto portfolio, BTC is a bad idea; the exchange fees will eat your lunch.  ETH is a better bet and has almost as many trading pairs on exchanges as BTC does, so it's a great way to get into alts (I've yet to find an alt I like that I couldn't buy with ETH).  

Unlike BTC, ETH also has a variety of use-cases supporting its value, not just speculation; Ethereum is a platform and ETH is a resource that must be spent to participate in that platform.  Beyond that, the Ethereum roadmap is exciting...transitioning to proof-of-stake, zk-SNARK integration for truly private and fungible transactions.  By some metrics the Ethereum blockchain also processes around 50% of all crypto transactions on a daily basis.  

LTC is a good holding, too, as it's been on a slow but steady upward trajectory for a long time.  However, I'm not real bullish on it, because it's committed to being nothing more than a BTC epiphyte...it's not really trying to compete with BTC for anything and is only really useful if it can capitalize on BTC remaining slow and expensive to use.  Whenever BTC adopts Lightning Network, LTC will basically get kicked to the curb.

BTC may keep appreciating, but the community is fragmented and seems to be focusing more energy on bad-mouthing Bitcoin Cash (BCH) than on solving their scaling issues.  I sold mine off around $8k and have no regrets, as the alts I exchanged it for have done much better over the same timeframe.  Ignore the fiat value of the coin and look at percentage gains.Sentiment: 0.10902777777777777

0 : 22:47:37 12/01/2017 : Yeah, couldn't agree more with this assessment. I'd also add Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, and Ethereum Classic as none of these deserve to be in the top 10.Sentiment: 0.38888888888888884

-3 : 17:25:58 12/01/2017 : Why are you so high on NEO? Very few teams are developing on their platform and the network effects around Ethereum are strong. I don't see why we would have two winners in this category.Sentiment: 0.11111111111111109

-10 : 02:27:17 12/02/2017 : No. 

Because ethereum has competitors like ark.

And a blockchain computer like eth/ark/anyone else are inherently in uncharted waters. No one knows who will win here.

But bitcoin has proven itself over last eight years. Its stable, and its not going anywhere.

5 : 23:27:37 12/01/2017 : > Beyond this, ADA cannot hide the fact that there is no tangible developments in place. At this point in time, the coin is simply vaporware. The mainnet is more of a litenet than anything, as none of the planned features are currently in place. In comparison to it‚Äôs competitors, such as ETH, IOTA, NEO, and WAVES, ADA is seriously lacking in terms of framework. The team, which parades its ‚Äúglobal background‚Äù, seems to be void of industry veterans and respected individuals within the crypto sphere.

Hard to disagree with that assessment. I think Cardano and it‚Äôs team are very prominent and could have a future, but this 450% with no news with features not implemented means this coin is gonna fall hard. In a year that won‚Äôt be the case since ADA will have a lot more stuff, I just think it‚Äôs way overvalued with fewer features than IOTA, NEO, etc.Sentiment: 0.06666666666666667
