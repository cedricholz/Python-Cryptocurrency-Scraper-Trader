*********************** VTC ***********************
1544 : 09:58:47 11/14/2017 : What is Vertcoin? A very informative infographic!

142 : 13:23:36 11/14/2017 : Genuine question: what does vertcoin have going for it that monero isn’t doing as well or better?

111 : 21:59:30 11/14/2017 : Hey guys, Vertcoin Dev here. There’s no doubt that our community can get a little...excited about VTC and go a bit overboard with the posting on r/cryptocurrency. We’ve seen this happening over the past few months and have kindly asked them to tone it down. Our recent jump in price also has also brought a lot of new people to Vertcoin and they seem to be just as excited to share.

One thing I’d like to clear up is that these posts and shills are not representative our our coin or larger community. We pride ourselves with that claim that we have one of the best communities in crypto and we truly believe it. We’ll continue to do our best to work with our community, but I just ask all of you judge Vertcoin objectively by its philosophy & technology and not by a few posts in a subreddit.

Thanks!


67 : 15:58:02 11/14/2017 : Is shilling successful enough to be worth the backlash? (e.g., Vertcoin hype)

61 : 15:07:06 11/14/2017 : It is a nice infographic but reactions seem to be calling OP a shill for communism or that vertcoin "don't know shit about economy". Much hate for an honest cryptocurrency here. 

51 : 14:21:23 11/14/2017 : dont own any vertcoin, but this kind of passion and quality design, you just have to respect!

38 : 09:59:15 11/14/2017 : Saw there was a need for some graphic propaganda, so I picked the infos here and there and made this. I hope it will help spreading the message!

36 : 16:04:14 11/14/2017 : The Vertcoin downvote brigade is insane.

20 : 16:56:39 11/14/2017 : VTC is the hero we have been waiting for

20 : 16:00:22 11/14/2017 : Good post and point. Vertcoin is a great coin but the shilling was pretty gross. It does seem as if the discussion around vertcoin has become more intelligent and less TO THE MOON ROFL which is great

19 : 13:48:04 11/14/2017 : Great info graphic, but I need some answers after reading it. 

1. Is a segwit good selling point? So far I only hear that it breaks 0-conf transactions and reduces security in Bitcoin. Could someone elaborate on the topic? 

2. Could anyone compare Vertcoin privacy to Monero? Are there any major differences? 

14 : 19:01:42 11/14/2017 : I've been debating this internally lately.  I own some VTC.  Got in at a great price and planned on holding long-term.  But the more shilling I see, the more I wonder if the price bumps are a result of echo-chamber hype or actual buy-in from the community.

Currently I'm sticking to my plan as a long hodl.  I agree with others here that say the community aspect of the coin naturally brings more excitement among people on messages boards.  

I'm keeping my eye on things though.  I think OP raises a good point.

14 : 09:19:39 11/14/2017 : I hope NAV will implement Atomic Swaps soon. Then there would be no reason for Vertcoin imo.

12 : 08:41:03 11/14/2017 : Yeah, the other day, I was specifically trying to find cons, and couldn't find any compelling ones. I could for other somewhat similar coins, like Vertcoin and Monero, which I'm invested in, but NAV just seems very undervalued for what it is.

11 : 16:01:54 11/14/2017 : If I’m being honest, I try and identify obvious shill campaigns early so I can get in and get out quick. Easy money. 

Either way the results speak for themselves, VTC has gone up and stayed up. That being said, VTC isn’t a bad coin and might actually deserve it. 

But yeah, the shilling is super gross. But it’s just one of a dozen seedy things about crypto right now anyway. 

11 : 16:02:14 11/14/2017 : Have you research about Vertcoin to try to understand why are people so passionate about Vertcoin? Vertcoin gives back the power to the people. Simple as that. That's why I love Vertcoin over any other coin. And I don't believe Vertcoin has a get rich quick scheme like ethereum did back in the day or like ripple does. Vertcoin to me has fundamentals, it is fair and decentralized. There is really not a reason to hate it.

11 : 16:40:34 11/14/2017 : I️ like this too. The only one I’m not sure about is VTC for 20%

9 : 20:15:52 11/14/2017 : Long Term you should have ETH.

If you go by %:

25% BTC
25% ETH
10% XMR

Long term these 3 will get you the better results. (if crypto keeps growing ofc)

Now the alt coins... that's up to you. If I had to advise something maybe. 10% VTC, 10% LTC, 10% NEO, 5% ARK, 5% LSK

8 : 17:17:18 11/14/2017 : EXCUSE ME HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT OUR LORD AND SAVIOR VERTCOIN THIS HOUR?

7 : 23:20:41 11/14/2017 : Just hiding transaction amounts is not anonymous. You still can see who sent to whom and how much someone owns. 
If John owns 10 LTC and a few hours later after selling his drugs on a DNM he owns 11 LTC, and Jim did a Confidential transaction to John, it’s easy to know that Jim sent 1 LTC to John. 
This is just a small confidentiality bonus and it isn’t even default.

IMHO Litecoin is endangered by Vertcoin. But I appreciate both currencies. 

6 : 17:08:38 11/14/2017 : As someone with very little experience and knowledge in the cryptocurrency arena, is this a viable currency for beginners to get in on? 

Reason I ask is, everything I've read about mining bitcoin is don't unless you have a self sustaining solar farm of 700 dedicated rigs mining 24/7. Is vertcoin a legitimate, self mineable solution?

If anyone has any information, or can point me to some literature or a beginners guide, I would appreciate it. 

6 : 21:12:13 11/14/2017 : You might be misattributing the boost in VTC value to the shilling campaigns. consider how much shilling IOTA has gotten, yet it's value hasn't maintained the tops.

5 : 15:32:44 11/14/2017 : As someone who doesn't really know a lot about bitcoin, where is one to start to understand it? It seems something worthwhile investing in, but is it really worth it? And what is the difference between Vertcoin and others, is it just easier?

5 : 19:05:43 11/14/2017 : tl;dr: stay ignorant, I don't care. That's on you.

I don't think you have a good idea about this coin, **and yes I actually shit and shat and spit all over this coin when I first heard about it**. But after a good hard look in the mirror about it's abilities, and what the power of an open source community is potentially able to accomplish. I've actually seen more pros coming out of VTC and it's community about ideas to tackle in this market with using their own tech then anywhere else in the crypto space. I'm not even joking, especially in the last 48 hours! This coin and its investors want to move, and the investors themselves can help move it by spreading more awareness, which is what you saw. Also the Radeon version of the One Click miner is also around the corner(Nvidia OCM is already out, was released last week) and the Discord I'm told is even more of active place.(I haven't had the time to sit down and chat- yet) *A lot of people say 'they've barely done any work in the last several months', thats completely untrue and misleading info.*



VTC at the end of the day just keeps looking like the real winner in this market for it's price point and it's governing tech. It's actually decentralized instead of false promises of decentralization which Bitcoins essentially spelling out the last couple weeks, it's also easily mined and doesn't require ridiculous amounts of power, and for those two reasons literally every GPU owner can simply mine it in their spare time and add to its decentralized network. I personally see that type of decentralized blockchain a lot better then allowing the only profitability be to those who've been set up and had a monopoly on ASIC-resist-free(ASIC Ruled) blockchains this entire time; Russia, China, Bitmain. If I had to choose between leaving this market and moving to VTC, I moved to VTC. I can't justify buying into a market that claims its decentralized if it really isn't, that's a pyramid I don't play with. And if it's true about Bitmain and Bitcoin, then I guarantee this market will eventually fail and we'll use Jamie Dimon coin in the future.



You want to use Jamie Dimon coin? Personally I sure as fuck don't want to leave a centralized economic system, to move to another centralized economic system, arguably to avoid this monopolized + centralized economic crossroad.



and BCH is not an acceptable replacement in this market. I feel bad for telling two personal friends to jump ship with me on Friday. we made a little money, but I couldn't pry them away! They wanted to stay and hodl! Oh God what the fuck did I do!? It's totally owned by Bitmain! Its all they accept for miners!



This markets turning into a secretive monopoly behind a lot of peoples backs very quickly that almost intentionally want to stay ignorant to it and drag other sheeple down with them, wake up and take the Green pill. 



5 : 01:59:33 11/15/2017 : Take 2:

* BTC 30.00%
* ETH 15.00%
* XMR 15.00%
* NEO 10.00%
* VTC 10.00%
* LSK 5.00%
* ARK 5.00%
* NAV 5.00%
* OMG 5.00%

5 : 13:56:47 11/14/2017 : I’m pretty sure this coin is dead unfortunately. Not trying to spread FUD or be unnecessarily negative but this coin was quite clearly and pump and dump off of vertcoin a success. Hopefully I’m wrong but I’m just trying to help anyone still holding it. 

4 : 14:34:50 11/14/2017 : The idea of promoting decentralization by design is great, but anyone interested in mining Vertcoin should read [this assessment](https://www.reddit.com/r/VertcoinMining/comments/7bucv8/mining_just_doesnt_make_sense/) on the current reality of it.

4 : 06:13:58 11/15/2017 : I have VTC, XMR, and NAV right now. I'm really strong on NAV. I'm looking into ARK and LISK. 

3 : 15:36:32 11/14/2017 : Vertcoin, is missing the #1 key feature - Governance built into protocol.  Just look at Bitcoin problems.  #2 - No DAO  #3 No selfing funding  #4 Not user friendly interface  #5 No marketing  #6  No on-chain scaling      This is why there is Dash and everything else.  Smartcash is also interesting too.  Vertcoin is a clone of Lite Coin, except since 2012.

3 : 20:19:40 11/14/2017 : Maybe *you're* a shill and this is reverse psychology. I can't help but notice I've never seen you and Vertcoin in the same room at the same time. 

3 : 22:08:36 11/14/2017 : I'm a to the moon guy myself, but I don't think worshiping the coin every day with a new nothing-post is a good way to build support for it. We lose people like you who are put off by the shill posts, while also pushing away potential new investors. Remember that there are a lot of people in the Vertcoin community who are not just in it for the money but see something more in it (and that doesn't just apply to Vertcoin, but to any other community with the same issue), but the people you see at the front are the to the moon types. :) 

Just my 2 cents.

2 : 10:13:08 11/14/2017 : Can I mine Vertcoin profitably on my 4 year old laptop?

Would it be worth my while even trying?

2 : 17:17:51 11/14/2017 : I'm sure nobody will be asking "Whats a Vertcoin?" next year....

2 : 17:56:10 11/14/2017 : Why does it have value though? Gold is valuable because people desire it for vanity reasons and a more legitimate use in circuits. Is the only value of vertcoin it's security?

2 : 23:50:54 11/14/2017 : Why is Vertcoin so cheap with such a community backing it?

2 : 20:15:48 11/14/2017 : but did you buy VTC cheap and are now 3 times richer is the question?

2 : 02:46:28 11/15/2017 : Guys I'm sorry to neg, but branding is everything. Vertcoin is a *shit name*.

Take an example from NEO (previously known as Antshares) and fix your branding problem.

2 : 16:10:17 11/14/2017 : There are a lot of first-time alt coin investors jumping onto vertcoin due to its recent (past month) rise.  Many are overly enthusiastic and simply don't know any better than to be over-the-top annoying about it.

  

Ignore the annoying shills, look into things for yourself. It's a decent coin.

1 : 13:25:00 11/14/2017 : Is it worth mining VTC on a R9 380 4GB graphics card? 

1 : 15:25:31 11/14/2017 : Noob question here, in Belgium it's not worth mining btc cuz of the high electricity bills, is mining vtc as intensive as btc? 

1 : 15:25:54 11/14/2017 : All you got for this work of art is 3.8 vtc tips??
LMAO!
Poor People's coin

1 : 17:44:34 11/14/2017 : I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

- [/r/vertcoin] [(Link) What is Vertcoin? A very informative infographic!](https://www.reddit.com/r/vertcoin/comments/7cx9v5/link_what_is_vertcoin_a_very_informative/)

&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*

1 : 22:27:16 11/14/2017 : Much Wow I’ve been on this Reddit for months and no one has mentioned vertcoin before 😂

1 : 05:24:39 11/15/2017 : Don't really understand Vertcoin, seems like just another fork.

1 : 02:55:53 11/15/2017 : What price did you get your VTC at?

1 : 21:41:34 11/14/2017 : I did some research and started mining it when it was in the $1 range and was pretty pleased. At first I liked that VTC was getting more attention but when it turns into shilling I start to question the validity of the attention. 

1 : 02:11:36 11/15/2017 : I've noticed VTC everywhere all the sudden also. I thought it was really strange.


1 : 06:12:33 11/15/2017 : Some vertcoin thoughts of mine (downvote me to frig if you'd like)

1. There are at least 5 other strictly currency coins with leads on market cap. Sure, I know the response "but the tech! Asic resistance!". Whatever, fact is there is competition well ahead in market share and that is my first point.

2. Asic resistance is ok, but is that really going to stop mining whales from significantly outpacing your average joe? I'd say no, but who knows maybe AMD/NVIDIA would have a problem selling a large chunk of their silicon to one buyer. 

3. That awful name. Ok this is petty and a matter of taste, but vertcoin makes me think of teenage skateboarders or old folks trying to be hip. Cringe. 

Well that's all, but what do I know? Yall will probably murder my gainz. 



1 : 01:04:15 11/15/2017 : Switch your VTC to ETH.  

I don't dislike VTC, but I still question whether it's earned a spot for long-term holding unless you really love speculating.  Even then, 20% is awfully high.  

I know ASIC-resistance is a very shiny concept right now, particularly because of the drama with Bitcoin, but I'm not convinced it's a long-term problem facing crypto.  Plenty of other coins can still actively fight centralized mining.  Monero has already pledged to hard fork if they deem it necessary.  And PoS coins, such as ARK, LSK, and NAV, don't have the problem at all.

1 : 02:15:12 11/15/2017 : So dropping an ASIC mined coin for another almost identical ASIC mined coin is a good idea? Interesting.

How about drop the Bitmain coins for something GPU mined like VTC.

0 : 14:02:20 11/14/2017 : It's a good infographic. But I don't like Vertcoin. Segwit adds nothing. ASIC resistance can also be found with Monero and privacywise that's the far better coin.

-2 : 16:45:26 11/14/2017 : What about GRS?? Isn't GRS an improved fork to Vertcoin?? Why is GRS only 1/6 of VTC market cap??

-6 : 18:16:31 11/14/2017 : How you know it's a shill coin.

1. Starts with a coordinated price talk injection. No points about what makes coin. OP makes that point

2. No new standout updates since 2014. What's really new since 2014? VTC posts updates on language additions, tweets out and then someone posts about it here. Making it sound like an actual update.

3. Dear goodness the upvotes (the main VTC post on the front page for example).

4. More coordination on the sub /r/Vertcoin about shilling. Theyre open and don't even care that other people see it. Please go see their sub.

5. They praise things that their coin does, that other currency does or mulitple do. 

6. Their lead Developer talks down other coins more than promoting his own.

Edit 

7. You have to have a dev come to this sub to defend the shills.

-12 : 18:43:35 11/14/2017 : Drop vtc for 20% bqx

-37 : 11:15:23 11/14/2017 : What is Vertcoin? Just another piece of shit crypto with a large cult following who have nothing better to do than spamming r/cc with VTC posts, that has nothing going for it that other crypto's aren't doing better.



*********************** ETH ***********************
197 : 17:00:33 11/14/2017 : Just found out there is ethereum Gold and ethereum Cash as well lol..

edit: I'm in deep boys. Just realized there is Litecoin Gold too.

edit 2: I believe I have reached the dark markets. I have unearthed Neo Gold.

edit 3: We have reached singularity. Just discovered ZCash Gold.

163 : 13:38:27 11/14/2017 : Ethereum Process Approximately Twice More Transactions Than Bitcoin

149 : 22:06:25 11/14/2017 : What? Tell your mom to stop being so close minded in the age of technology.

Post me an ETH address. I'll send you $150 worth of ETH to tell your mom the truth and prove to her crypto investing gives people like me the ability to shit-comment like this. Then another $150 worth of ETH if you have a photo of your mom with a sign that has a timestamp acknowledging /r/cryptocurrency

Edit: This first half of the offer will be good for 2 hours. The second half 24 hours from this comment.


52 : 18:25:19 11/14/2017 : Personally, I can't imagine a long term portfolio without ETH in it. They're the biggest dapp platform, and unless you think NEO is going to steam-roll them straight out of existence, then ETH is just going to grow as more and more dapps come out and are actually *used*.

30 : 18:44:34 11/14/2017 : 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 
 
Landmark year for crypto. The masses are coming. Be happy. Be very very happy.

And rightfully ETH is first on that banner. I'm calling it now this time next year ETH will have the biggest market cap. Quote me. Thank me. 

16 : 20:59:47 11/14/2017 : Long-term musts for me are: IOTA, XMR, ETH and/or NEO

15 : 17:47:13 11/14/2017 : I always use ETH for transferring value

15 : 06:15:38 11/15/2017 : Ethereum currently hundreds of times faster and cheaper than Bitcoin

12 : 17:29:15 11/14/2017 : Interesting eth is befor btc

12 : 23:31:54 11/14/2017 : Confido (CFD). Let me call it the cryptocurrency Ebay as an example use case. Where you dont have to trust buyer or seller and have funds held in escrow in a smartcontract using oracle (chainlink) to release the funds after delivery has been made (shipment tracking). Outstanding ICO with fair distribution (max. 3 ETH) and a freaking low hardcap of about 400k USD. 
Marketcap about 10MM.

11 : 16:02:14 11/14/2017 : Have you research about Vertcoin to try to understand why are people so passionate about Vertcoin? Vertcoin gives back the power to the people. Simple as that. That's why I love Vertcoin over any other coin. And I don't believe Vertcoin has a get rich quick scheme like ethereum did back in the day or like ripple does. Vertcoin to me has fundamentals, it is fair and decentralized. There is really not a reason to hate it.

9 : 20:15:52 11/14/2017 : Long Term you should have ETH.

If you go by %:

25% BTC
25% ETH
10% XMR

Long term these 3 will get you the better results. (if crypto keeps growing ofc)

Now the alt coins... that's up to you. If I had to advise something maybe. 10% VTC, 10% LTC, 10% NEO, 5% ARK, 5% LSK

9 : 13:56:42 11/14/2017 : Looking to buy ethereum

9 : 08:35:33 11/14/2017 : Why ETH is the next big wave.

7 : 18:24:44 11/14/2017 : I sold my lambo to go all in on Eth. Should be over $1000 in a month.

5 : 01:59:33 11/15/2017 : Take 2:

* BTC 30.00%
* ETH 15.00%
* XMR 15.00%
* NEO 10.00%
* VTC 10.00%
* LSK 5.00%
* ARK 5.00%
* NAV 5.00%
* OMG 5.00%

5 : 18:58:46 11/14/2017 : If they do it right, the DApp development challenge will give a lot of attention to this project, also outside of the crypto sphere. I think a lot of people underestimate how much value this project gives to the ethereum ecosystem.

5 : 20:47:53 11/14/2017 : Hey, nice seeing WAX on /r/CryptoCurrency!

Highly recommend looking into this.

Gamers should understand pretty quickly, but others should learn as well.

check out the subreddit for more info /r/waxtoken 

https://twitter.com/opskinsgo

https://twitter.com/WAXToken

Biggest project with immediate integration. 50 Billion dollar market, 400+ million gamers making transactions. OPSkins is #1 in trading digital assets like skins. They process between 15b and 23b of the 50 billion market.

WAX will be a utility token, not only currency. It allows decentralized marketplaces with trustless trades. No game integration required.

It will start as ETH token, but will be developing their own DPOS blockchain for the volume and features it will allow. It will use every feature of DPOS as a tool. 

 completion planned for end of 2018/start of 2019.

OPSkins will not be the only marketplace to use WAX, it will be it's first user of WAX. WAX solves a lot of problems. 

OPSkins is a global company with the majority of trades being different countries with different currencies. These conversion fees are a problem. Introducing WAX ;)

Passionate supporter, no affiliation other than I invested in the Gamer sale.

5 : 20:56:02 11/14/2017 : Also, Amber is a pure utility token, the CEO came out and said they don’t want it to go up in price as the token itself is only for utility, it’s a big reason why I didn’t invest.  I was going to but then I backed away from it.  

Nice thing about MOD is they pay out dividends in the form of ETH.  I love passive income so that’s why I went with MOD instead of AMB.

5 : 23:51:28 11/14/2017 : Just bought into Iexec myself. I found it really heady and boring type of stuff, BUT:

- Cloud based Dapps that are decentralized. Releasing a "store" for these dapps in December.
- Started on eth, but can/is moving to other blockchains.
- French roots and Huge co-development program partnership with China.
- They are currently recruiting developers to work on their newly developed sdk. 
- Apparently, really good feedback from devcon regarding this sdk.
- Running a contest to develop dapps for their store.
- Projected to be in market thats worth $200 Billion in 2020. (Current mrktcap is 45+mill.) 
- Read a few places people were calling it the "AirBnB for servers."

CONS

- Minimal marketing for the time being. 
- Word of mouth will drive this tech. 

Wonderful investment in my opinion. 



4 : 19:25:57 11/14/2017 : People are always going to biased in favour of their own holdings, whether BTC or BCH. No one wants to lose money. That said, if BTC transactions keep being this expensive and slow for too long, usage may move to BCH and kill BTC altogether like what happened with ETH and ETC.

4 : 21:23:46 11/14/2017 : I'd add ETH and OMG

4 : 07:00:12 11/15/2017 :  * [OmiseGo](http://wcibtc.com/omg) - BTC fork hit OMG hard. No reason for it not to be breaking ATH's with their mainnet release due early next year

 * [Request Network](http://wcibtc.com/req) - Still selling around ICO price. Criminally undervalued which their detailed roadmap, open and concise AMA's and solid partner backings. I've been loading up the last 3 weeks.

 * [IOTA](http://wcibtc.com/iota) - Obligatory IOTA inclusion. "Big December News" Def worth buying the rumour imho

 * [Monero](http://wcibtc.com/xmr) - Although I wonder how both BTC & ETH privacy updates will effect Monero, I still think it has huge potential.

3 : 23:18:03 11/14/2017 : Thank you everyone for upvoting. Thank you u/slickguy for sending me $150 worth of ETH. I'm still struggling to process it. 

3 : 04:42:36 11/15/2017 : I got into cryptos thanks to mining, I started in the recent ETH boom, I had by pure luck bought an RX480 for 170$ before all the now a days shortages and high prices. 

I did some math and intermediately started mining (I had no idea at all of what I was doing) I was using nicehash and I had to wait until I had 10 mBTC for my first payment, I was skeptical about them paying me at all. By that time It only took less than 7 days to get to 10 mBTC. 

When I was 3 days away from being paid and told my mom and dad about what I was doing, they said good job, nice!, but they didn't look surprised at all/had very little interest (likely thought it was an scam), surprisingly it was my grandma that knew something about BTC when I told her what I was doing.

It wasnt until I had my first payment that my father started researching and asking me questions about cryptos, the following day my whole family was discussing about cryptos.

And now well, my entire family is mining/going to mine right now. Even my father asked me if he could buy some of my BTCs.

Mining it's been a miracle for us, even with the ''low'' profits of today, I still pull several times the minimum wage here (venezuela).


3 : 06:23:24 11/15/2017 : Agree. The Ethereum community is far more focused on creating a winning product rather than just making money. Ironically, in this end this will see Ethereum with the most money and Bitcoin creating a bad product that's good for nothing other than parking your money. 

Bitcoin's got the name though - it'll probably only increase in value, and the fact that it's hideously clunky and expensive for everyday transactions will mean it will only be hoarded and not really spent. 

2 : 02:58:07 11/15/2017 : Make sure she doesn’t confuse eth and meth!

2 : 17:59:35 11/14/2017 : Wow. This basically is a slap in the face that I need to start buying the bigger name coins.... wow. 

I’m 100% in alt coins. Guess I’m buying ETH next...

2 : 04:29:10 11/15/2017 : ETH positioned first :) all is fine

2 : 01:44:10 11/15/2017 : Impressive. It probably has more transactions due to trading bots and People moving to and from different alts to day trade. It makes more sense to use ethereum due to the lower transaction cost.

Can it scale up to the level of visa and other bank transactions?

2 : 19:43:51 11/14/2017 : That's how ethereum started

2 : 18:35:02 11/14/2017 : If anyone wants to see how an ico should take place check out CFD. Market cap at $400k, limit of only 2 ETH per investor with a whitelist process to ensure no duplicate investors. Developers secured 30% of the coins which is fine as they require an income from the dividends provided and this is locked up until a working beta is released.

Why does Bloom need $50m to create this project? If they believe in tge project they should raise far less and keep a small percentage of coins for themselves to make a gain on future sucess of the coin.

Im no longer investing in high cap icos i think they are a scam unless they have a working product with proven returns.


2 : 23:19:48 11/14/2017 : Where's IOTA and ETH for long term? 

2 : 01:47:37 11/15/2017 : Copy-pasting from my response to [yesterday's shill thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7cskd2/coins_with_low_market_cap_and_high_potential/).

[**Pink**](https://np.reddit.com/r/PinkApp/comments/79bx75/pinkapp_faq_a_blockchainfunded_dividendproducing/). High-risk, high-reward.

Business model that just makes sense, tapping into the $200b sex industry. Not trying to invent new technology; just leveraging existing privacy and blockchain tech to create the [Uber/AirBnB of escorting apps](https://vimeo.com/239655911). Clients pay in cash, escorts pay a commission to Pink, dividends go to investors via ETH and/or XMR.

Series A investment closed, Series B opening in a few weeks at $2.50/share with IPO target for 2018 Q1 at $10. Only about $1m invested during Series A. Beta launch in Toronto targeted for December/January. Rollout in other major cities to follow.

Even more bullish on it since [Eros-Guide was recently raided](http://www.xbiz.com/news/231580/report-eros-guides-call-center-is-raided) by the Department of Homeland Security. There's a need for a site that can protect both client/escort personal information and provide a slick, convenient booking experience for both parties.

1 : 22:23:49 11/14/2017 : I've been making a lot of Ethereum transactions recently and it's completely painless. Much better than bitcoin!

1 : 00:48:14 11/15/2017 : Fairly sure this isn’t an apples to apples comparison due to the difference in the way that bitcoin and ethereum transactions are constructed. Bitcoin uses UTXOs while ethereum uses accounts. 

1 : 06:44:25 11/15/2017 : that's funny, XRP is 40x faster than ETH and can process 100x more transactions.

1 : 18:27:26 11/14/2017 : LTC, ETH and NEM missing for me. 

1 : 19:46:33 11/14/2017 : No eth? Why so much lisk?

1 : 23:59:59 11/14/2017 : ETH is a MUST!! 

1 : 01:04:15 11/15/2017 : Switch your VTC to ETH.  

I don't dislike VTC, but I still question whether it's earned a spot for long-term holding unless you really love speculating.  Even then, 20% is awfully high.  

I know ASIC-resistance is a very shiny concept right now, particularly because of the drama with Bitcoin, but I'm not convinced it's a long-term problem facing crypto.  Plenty of other coins can still actively fight centralized mining.  Monero has already pledged to hard fork if they deem it necessary.  And PoS coins, such as ARK, LSK, and NAV, don't have the problem at all.

1 : 06:38:43 11/15/2017 : Pretty awesome tech, and I agree it's an improvement over BTC. Then again, IOTA takes the fee//TX time to a unbeatable level. I can't wait to see how they'll compete with Ethereum in a year or so. Ethereum has its shit together.

1 : 06:41:17 11/15/2017 : We all know ETH is better. Just give people time. They will realize this soon.

1 : 06:45:09 11/15/2017 : When I’m injecting fiat into my portfolio I use ETH now. No brainer. Keep your money. 

1 : 07:04:29 11/15/2017 : https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6ef4lw/transferring_ethereum_from_coinbase_to_nano/

ethereum transactions should usually post very quickly (miinutes) but the parts that connect to traditional banking/credit are kinda slow. you might also check whether you need to confirm the transaction on email. 




1 : 06:58:32 11/15/2017 : Iota or RaiBlocks.  If by micropayment you mean >$0.01 but <$1.00, ethereum still works very well at the moment.

0 : 21:30:46 11/14/2017 : The only thing that ticks me off, is they include stuff like dash, and not featured here ethereum classic on every other advert all over london (and these guys are all over london).

But nonetheless, publicity and more awareness is good!

0 : 22:56:41 11/14/2017 : I would add NAV and ETH. I'm not really too sure about ARK. And LSK seems like more of a short-term buy with their new tech and partnerships.. not sure about long term prospects. 

0 : 23:50:01 11/14/2017 : This is my long term portfolio:

http://www.coinparator.com/yKwJQH/

I know, that a lot of my coins are in the red. That's because I put this portfolio together right before BTC crash (when it touched $5000 and then crashed). But since then most of the coins are recovering and rising again. I would recommend you any coin from my portfolio EXCEPT following: XAS, STRAT, TENX, MCO, EBET (these were mistakes).

If I have to be specific, you are mainly missing LTC, ETH and maybe some WAVES/OMG.

0 : 07:05:47 11/15/2017 : I don't think transaction volume and confirmation speeds should be taken without looking at the impact it has on security. A blockchain is firstly a decentralized security mechanism. Trading off that security for speed and scalability is not really impressive. If that becomes the metric, then old protocols like PayPal end up being the winner anyway. 

The transaction volume with Ethereum goes at the expense of a bigger bandwidth and disk requirements. Shorter confirmations are less sure to not be rolled back by a group of miners. 

The goal is to reach all those metrics with the highest decentralized security possible _and_ improving capabilities and developer tools at the service time.

Now the Ethereum community is really doing this. With constant improvements on clients requiring less bandwidth, less disk usage, higher processing speeds, more features and a huge community working on building tools. But I don't think it's fair to say it's better at everything because of that. 

0 : 19:38:55 11/14/2017 : Ethereum payment channels.

*********************** XMR ***********************
320 : 11:56:59 11/14/2017 : > "Top privacy"

Monero doesn't agree.

142 : 13:23:36 11/14/2017 : Genuine question: what does vertcoin have going for it that monero isn’t doing as well or better?

21 : 20:10:01 11/14/2017 : I recommend even more XMR. It’s going to be the main currency of the darknet markets in the future so it has a lot of room to grow.

19 : 13:48:04 11/14/2017 : Great info graphic, but I need some answers after reading it. 

1. Is a segwit good selling point? So far I only hear that it breaks 0-conf transactions and reduces security in Bitcoin. Could someone elaborate on the topic? 

2. Could anyone compare Vertcoin privacy to Monero? Are there any major differences? 

16 : 20:59:47 11/14/2017 : Long-term musts for me are: IOTA, XMR, ETH and/or NEO

13 : 21:20:22 11/14/2017 : because of the confidential transactions? lol!

bitcoin will hardfork to implement and ltc will just add it as a feature that 99% won't even realize was added.

no, i'd say monero will be fine.

12 : 08:41:03 11/14/2017 : Yeah, the other day, I was specifically trying to find cons, and couldn't find any compelling ones. I could for other somewhat similar coins, like Vertcoin and Monero, which I'm invested in, but NAV just seems very undervalued for what it is.

11 : 11:24:28 11/14/2017 : WOW! Manager from other department tips in XMR

10 : 20:48:43 11/14/2017 : John McAfee: „Litecoin and Bitcoin making a move against Monero“

9 : 00:56:14 11/15/2017 : Bitcoin Cash? Where is Monero?

9 : 20:15:52 11/14/2017 : Long Term you should have ETH.

If you go by %:

25% BTC
25% ETH
10% XMR

Long term these 3 will get you the better results. (if crypto keeps growing ofc)

Now the alt coins... that's up to you. If I had to advise something maybe. 10% VTC, 10% LTC, 10% NEO, 5% ARK, 5% LSK

5 : 01:59:33 11/15/2017 : Take 2:

* BTC 30.00%

* NEO 10.00%
* VTC 10.00%
* LSK 5.00%
* ARK 5.00%
* NAV 5.00%
* OMG 5.00%

4 : 06:13:58 11/15/2017 : I have VTC, XMR, and NAV right now. I'm really strong on NAV. I'm looking into ARK and LISK. 

4 : 07:00:12 11/15/2017 :  * [OmiseGo](http://wcibtc.com/omg) - BTC fork hit OMG hard. No reason for it not to be breaking ATH's with their mainnet release due early next year

 * [Request Network](http://wcibtc.com/req) - Still selling around ICO price. Criminally undervalued which their detailed roadmap, open and concise AMA's and solid partner backings. I've been loading up the last 3 weeks.

 * [IOTA](http://wcibtc.com/iota) - Obligatory IOTA inclusion. "Big December News" Def worth buying the rumour imho

 * [Monero](http://wcibtc.com/xmr) - Although I wonder how both BTC & ETH privacy updates will effect Monero, I still think it has huge potential.

3 : 23:48:48 11/14/2017 : Every time I see ads like this for coins, I just assume is a pump and dump and stay FAR AWAY. 

Do you own research, come to your own conclusions.

For me, right now, it's Bitcoin and Monero.

3 : 11:47:13 11/14/2017 : Cool thanks for this, I've been seeing a lot of superficial info, but haven't done a deep dive.  It looks a lot like xmr without the privacy aspect, correct?

2 : 05:18:26 11/15/2017 : You can tax my Monero, which I have an undisclosed amount of.

1 : 06:41:28 11/15/2017 : Note to self, don't mention the word privacy around here if it doesn't involve XMR. Pretty sure XMR guys have some sort of email list that send notifications every time someone does because god damn they fuckin hit this thread like crazy.

0 : 14:02:20 11/14/2017 : It's a good infographic. But I don't like Vertcoin. Segwit adds nothing. ASIC resistance can also be found with Monero and privacywise that's the far better coin.

2 : 02:46:28 11/15/2017 : Guys I'm sorry to neg, but branding is everything. Vertcoin is a *shit name*.

Take an example from NEO (previously known as Antshares) and fix your branding problem.

2 : 06:06:35 11/15/2017 : I got NEO, OMG, ARK, LISK locked and loaded. I got too much money invested in Crypto for this to fail ;)

Edit: Spelling

1 : 19:42:47 11/14/2017 : NEO can do more.

-1 : 22:23:20 11/14/2017 : Let’s talk about Neo 1,000 transactions per second with capabilities going up to 10,000 a second 

-5 : 06:13:08 11/15/2017 : The author's problem is that he bought Chinacoin, literally. NEO was developed in China by Chinese nationalists. People forget, while China is more capitalistic than it was 20 years ago, it's still run by the communist party. The government there has absolute control. 

Also, NEO was pumped like mad shortly before and after August 1st (Segwit & bitcoin fiasco), there was no question it's value was going to fall after the dust settled. Buying into a currency that just renamed itself and was massively pumped around a time of uncertainty is foolish no matter how you cut it. And I would never buy into Chinacoin no matter what it promises, I don't like the idea of China controlling my investment (if they don't now, they certainly will if it ever gains enough marketshare -- they can just march in and sieze control and nobody could do anything to stop them). That's what you risk when you buy into something in one of the most authoritarian governments on the planet.

7 : 16:22:10 11/14/2017 : This actually looks pretty awesome. Although I still think LTC will be a bigger contender long run.

7 : 23:20:41 11/14/2017 : Just hiding transaction amounts is not anonymous. You still can see who sent to whom and how much someone owns. 
If John owns 10 LTC and a few hours later after selling his drugs on a DNM he owns 11 LTC, and Jim did a Confidential transaction to John, it’s easy to know that Jim sent 1 LTC to John. 
This is just a small confidentiality bonus and it isn’t even default.

IMHO Litecoin is endangered by Vertcoin. But I appreciate both currencies. 

6 : 23:54:50 11/14/2017 : Charlie Lee drops NO2X, adopts LTC instead encouraging others to do the same

3 : 21:03:43 11/14/2017 : a simple answer - Litecoin.

- pay nearly everywhere with it 
- world wide accepted
 

2 : 00:31:01 11/15/2017 : If people think bitcoin is undervalued, what is litecoin? (no sly remarks pls)

1 : 18:27:26 11/14/2017 : LTC, ETH and NEM missing for me. 

1 : 00:58:41 11/15/2017 : I got 99% NAV .1% LTC .9% BTC. I believe I will go to the MoOoOoOoOoN, from my LTC.

1 : 23:14:28 11/14/2017 : litecoin triple digits before year end.

0 : 23:50:01 11/14/2017 : This is my long term portfolio:

http://www.coinparator.com/yKwJQH/

I know, that a lot of my coins are in the red. That's because I put this portfolio together right before BTC crash (when it touched $5000 and then crashed). But since then most of the coins are recovering and rising again. I would recommend you any coin from my portfolio EXCEPT following: XAS, STRAT, TENX, MCO, EBET (these were mistakes).

If I have to be specific, you are mainly missing LTC, ETH and maybe some WAVES/OMG.

-1 : 01:22:32 11/15/2017 : Come over to Litecoin, there's literally 0 toxicity there



*********************** ZEC ***********************
197 : 17:00:33 11/14/2017 : Just found out there is ethereum Gold and ethereum Cash as well lol..

edit: I'm in deep boys. Just realized there is Litecoin Gold too.

edit 2: I believe I have reached the dark markets. I have unearthed Neo Gold.

edit 3: We have reached singularity. Just discovered ZCash Gold.



*********************** NAV ***********************
25 : 08:08:28 11/14/2017 : Does anyone have anything bad to say about NAV?

14 : 09:19:39 11/14/2017 : I hope NAV will implement Atomic Swaps soon. Then there would be no reason for Vertcoin imo.

12 : 08:41:03 11/14/2017 : Yeah, the other day, I was specifically trying to find cons, and couldn't find any compelling ones. I could for other somewhat similar coins, like Vertcoin and Monero, which I'm invested in, but NAV just seems very undervalued for what it is.

11 : 12:50:53 11/14/2017 : I can't say anything definitely **bad**. However I have several points that I am sceptical about. One is the anonymity, and how it is achieved. I read the whitepaper and was confused about it. It looks to me like it is less than solid. More like obscuring transactions via a side-chain and not really untraceable when it comes to inputs and outputs. I'm not certain, just sceptical so don't take my word for it.

I'm also sceptical that such a small project is going to be able to deliver everything they plan. It aims to have dapps that are anonymous. That is no small task. I think that a coin such as NAV, with PoS, attempted privacy/anonymity, dapps etc. Will try too much to be a jack of all trades and fail to be really good at anything. Again, this is speculation on my part, just how I see it.

Last time I heard, they only had part time devs. Perhaps that has changed now.

usually the really smart investors are early to catch potential. IMO the reason NAV is valued low is...because it is not worth more. The expert investors usually have these things pinned down pretty well and as soon as NAV delivers something big, the price will most likely rise, if not before due to hype from regular users. When enough holders of NAV shill it, here for example, it will catch up.

Now I know it sounds as if I dislike NAV, I don't. I just try to stay realistic about projects. I don't think that it is so much NAV that is undervalued, as other coins being overvalued. Just look at Verge for example, waaay overvalued. NAV is a better project, however that does not mean it should be priced higher. It all depends on what you compare with. Compared to shitcoins with higher marketcap, I believe that NAV is undervalued. Compared to the big/groundbreaking projects, I think NAV is pretty good where it is, for now. 

TLDR: Nothing wrong with NAV, it just has to prove to actually do something unique. So far it is just grand plans. 



10 : 09:08:34 11/14/2017 : Here is an excellent description of what NAV is all about. I found this informative and jumped in about %15 of my portfolio. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzSF7lpk2IE

7 : 01:30:05 11/15/2017 : NAV Coin (NAV)

5 : 01:59:33 11/15/2017 : Take 2:

* BTC 30.00%
* ETH 15.00%
* XMR 15.00%
* NEO 10.00%
* VTC 10.00%
* LSK 5.00%
* ARK 5.00%
* NAV 5.00%
* OMG 5.00%

4 : 12:15:52 11/14/2017 : They could market themselves better.


Edit: just found out that they are 75% through planning there marketing roadmap. According to here: https://navcoin.org/project-roadmap/ - I guess they are working on it.

4 : 06:13:58 11/15/2017 : I have VTC, XMR, and NAV right now. I'm really strong on NAV. I'm looking into ARK and LISK. 

1 : 00:58:41 11/15/2017 : I got 99% NAV .1% LTC .9% BTC. I believe I will go to the MoOoOoOoOoN, from my LTC.

1 : 01:04:15 11/15/2017 : Switch your VTC to ETH.  

I don't dislike VTC, but I still question whether it's earned a spot for long-term holding unless you really love speculating.  Even then, 20% is awfully high.  

I know ASIC-resistance is a very shiny concept right now, particularly because of the drama with Bitcoin, but I'm not convinced it's a long-term problem facing crypto.  Plenty of other coins can still actively fight centralized mining.  Monero has already pledged to hard fork if they deem it necessary.  And PoS coins, such as ARK, LSK, and NAV, don't have the problem at all.

1 : 06:15:32 11/15/2017 : For sure ark and xlm. I’d like to see bat and nav but, think I’ve gotta wait awhile for those two 

0 : 22:56:41 11/14/2017 : I would add NAV and ETH. I'm not really too sure about ARK. And LSK seems like more of a short-term buy with their new tech and partnerships.. not sure about long term prospects. 



*********************** LSK ***********************
67 : 12:08:12 11/14/2017 : Lisk Explorer 1.4.0 — Enhanced UX/UI, Improved Performance, Bug Fixes, and Website Analytics

9 : 20:15:52 11/14/2017 : Long Term you should have ETH.

If you go by %:

25% BTC
25% ETH
10% XMR

Long term these 3 will get you the better results. (if crypto keeps growing ofc)

Now the alt coins... that's up to you. If I had to advise something maybe. 10% VTC, 10% LTC, 10% NEO, 5% ARK, 5% LSK

9 : 06:30:49 11/15/2017 : LISK - Don't let this opportunity go by you!

5 : 01:59:33 11/15/2017 : Take 2:

* BTC 30.00%
* ETH 15.00%
* XMR 15.00%
* NEO 10.00%
* VTC 10.00%
* LSK 5.00%
* ARK 5.00%
* NAV 5.00%
* OMG 5.00%

4 : 06:13:58 11/15/2017 : I have VTC, XMR, and NAV right now. I'm really strong on NAV. I'm looking into ARK and LISK. 

2 : 06:06:35 11/15/2017 : I got NEO, OMG, ARK, LISK locked and loaded. I got too much money invested in Crypto for this to fail ;)

Edit: Spelling

1 : 19:46:33 11/14/2017 : No eth? Why so much lisk?

1 : 01:04:15 11/15/2017 : Switch your VTC to ETH.  

I don't dislike VTC, but I still question whether it's earned a spot for long-term holding unless you really love speculating.  Even then, 20% is awfully high.

1 : 07:29:53 11/15/2017 : seriously which lisk. hydralisk, mutalisk, ultralisk? what kind of amateur grade post is this?

1 : 06:51:54 11/15/2017 : Definitely will be. Buying into LISK and then upping my XMR and then hodl’n hard :)

0 : 22:56:41 11/14/2017 : I would add NAV and ETH. I'm not really too sure about ARK. And LSK seems like more of a short-term buy with their new tech and partnerships.. not sure about long term prospects. 

-7 : 14:57:26 11/14/2017 : Do people actually think lisk will compete with ethereum or is this very wishful thinking?

-10 : 18:38:57 11/14/2017 : lisk failed long time ago

20 : 18:10:21 11/14/2017 : Bread Wallet Announces Support for ERC20 Tokens and Bitcoin Cash

10 : 18:11:21 11/14/2017 : Lets also consider that BTC is under threat right now, lost around 25% of it's market share to Bitcoin Cash over the last week, and many BTC holders - which there are *a lot* more of - will be shilling and spreading FUD to defend their bags.  

Also be aware that Bitcoin Core organizes harassment, FUD, and trolling campaigns: http://telegra.ph/Inside-the-Dragons-Den-Bitcoin-Cores-Troll-Army-04-07

Yesterday they were vote botting in /r/btc to make it look like they were just pumpers: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7cp4v0/buy_bitcoin_cash_right_now_youre_gonna_regret_it/

And if you've been watching /r/bitcoin you've probably seen the character assassinations, that are completely unrelated to the scaling debate, on those who support Bitcoin Cash including Vitalik now.

9 : 00:56:14 11/15/2017 : Bitcoin Cash? Where is Monero?

8 : 23:50:20 11/14/2017 : Son Litecoin is massively undervalued proportionately to its Daddy Bitcoin and little Sister Bitcoin Cash

8 : 17:23:25 11/14/2017 : Bittylicious now allow trade with Bitcoin Cash

3 : 20:54:30 11/14/2017 : I am one of those bag holders who bought at $2500. I will be buying more Bitcoin Cash to average the cost down. 

2 : 01:24:23 11/15/2017 : "I want everyone to think that we're fighting so the prices drop and Wall Street can make small buys on Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash while normies give up their bags....." 

1 : 22:18:59 11/14/2017 : How funny, the ones I've been spotting in London the last few weeks all have Ethereum Classic instead of bitcoin cash. They must just have changed that

1 : 07:08:14 11/15/2017 : That there's Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash would seem pretty cryptic to many probably.

1 : 01:03:53 11/15/2017 : I remember the days leading up to the not yet canceled fork and everyone was punished for not having bitcoin. Literally every alt coin was in the red, and bitcoin fans were jumping for joy. Then, when they had a taste of their own medicine, and Bitcoin Cash was pumped, they whined and cried like four year olds after having a legendary 2017. I have both, so I don't care, I am more into other crypto assets besides those two. It just shows you how manipulative those hodlers can be, it becomes toxic really fast.

1 : 04:37:26 11/15/2017 : “ By introducing Bitcoin Cash as a hard fork and airdrop, the team played their trump card pretty quickly. This focus on politics rather than on making Bitcoin a better currency overall has proven quite problematic.”

Wut. Are they talking about Core or Cash?
